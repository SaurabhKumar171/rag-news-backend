    "summary": "The US president says illegal migration \"destroys countries from within\", as his two-day state visit to the UK comes to a close.",
    "text": "Donald Trump suggested Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer could use the military to stop illegal migration at a news conference marking the end of the US president's second state visit to the UK. Trump said he discussed migration issues with Sir Keir during a meeting at his country residence Chequers. The US president talked about his policies to secure borders in the US and said the UK faced a similar challenge with migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats. \"You have people coming in and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use,\" Trump said. \"It destroys countries from within and we're actually now removing a lot of the people that came into our country.\" Since his return to the White House in January, Trump has stepped up deportations of illegal immigrants and cracked down on unlawful border crossings.  In two days of pomp and pageantry, the US president was hosted at Windsor Castle by King Charles and the Royal Family, and attended a state banquet on Wednesday before his political talks with the prime minister on Thursday.  The President and First Lady Melania Trump departed the UK from Stansted Airport on Air Force One shortly after the news conference. In a wide-ranging Q&A with UK and US journalists, the leaders were also asked about Palestinian statehood, free speech, the war in Ukraine, energy and other topics. The pair touted the \"special relationship\" between the UK and the US, and announced a new tech deal Trump said would help the allies \"dominate\" in the world of artificial intelligence (AI). The tech prosperity deal signed at Chequers will see US firms invest in the UK and boost co-operation on AI, quantum and other emerging technologies. Trump and Sir Keir skirted around several contentious matters, including accusations of free speech being under attack in Britain, and the sacking of Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the US last week. \"I don't know him actually,\" Trump said, when asked about whether he had sympathy with Lord Mandelson. In what could have been an awkward moment, Trump defused the question by handing over to Sir Keir, who fired Lord Mandelson over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein. In one flashpoint, Trump said he had \"a disagreement with the prime minister\" on the subject of Palestinian statehood. The prime minister plans to recognise Palestinian statehood ahead of next week's United Nations general assembly in New York. Palestine does have some international recognition but has no internationally agreed boundaries, no capital and no army.  Currently 147 of the UN's 193 member states have recognised Palestine. By joining that list the UK would be making a strong political statement, albeit a largely symbolic one. Trump is opposed to such a move and accused Palestinian armed group Hamas of \"putting the hostages up as bait\" in Gaza. The war in Ukraine came up in a few questions too, with Trump expressing his disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin over his lack of engagement with peace efforts. \"He's really let me down,\" Trump said. Trump also urged Western allies to stop buying Russian oil to force Putin to the negotiating table, but did not commit to sanctioning Moscow. There were no divisions between Trump and Starmer on action to tackle illegal migration, as the leaders projected a sense of unity and affection for each other. Standing alongside Trump, the prime minister said illegal migration was an issue his government had been taking \"incredibly seriously\". Sir Keir said his government had struck several migrant returns deals with other countries, including France, and had been taking action to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. The prime minister pointed to the first migrant return under the one-in, one-out scheme with France. \"That's an important step forward,\" Sir Keir said. \"But there's no silver bullet here.\" More than 30,000 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year. It is the earliest point in a calendar year this figure has been passed since data on crossings was first reported in 2018. The rise in crossings is one of the most prominent issues in British politics and has piled pressure on the prime minister to come up with a solution. As part of his drive to tackle illegal immigration, Trump has issued a series of executive orders implementing a broad ban on asylum for migrants entering at the southern border and has sent in troops to assist border security efforts. The arrests of migrants by the US Border Patrol have been decreasing since Trump took office. The late-night host criticised the Republican response to the killing and his  suspension came after pressure from the regulator. Wales' first minister goes further with her explanations for not joining the US president. President Trump says he will designate Antifa as a terror group, but legal experts have questioned whether this is possible.

    "summary": "The US and UK leaders fielded questions on Ukraine, migration, free speech and Mandelson among other issues.",
    "text": "Sir Keir Starmer and Donald Trump have delivered a joint press conference at the end of the US president's second state visit to the UK. The press conference at the PM's country residence Chequers, lasting just under an hour, saw the leaders field questions on topics ranging from world affairs to domestic politics. Trump spoke warmly about his relationship with the UK, and largely avoided talking about contentious issues that came up in the questioning. Here are the main points. The UK's imminent recognition of Palestinian statehood was a potential flashpoint, with Trump having previously said that the move could reward Hamas. But asked directly about the UK's plans, Trump merely noted that he had a \"disagreement\" with Starmer on the issue, adding for good measure that it was one of only a \"few disagreements\" between the pair. Starmer emphasised that the timing of the UK's decision, which is set to take place in the coming days, had \"nothing to do\" with Trump's visit, and should be seen in the context of an overall plan for a \"plan for peace\" in the Middle East. And he added that Hamas, a designated terror group in the UK, could play \"no part\" in any future Palestinian state. Those comments were warmly welcomed by Trump, with the US president reaching across his podium to give Starmer a pat on the back.  Trump was also given a chance to comment on another tricky political issue for Starmer - his efforts to stop illegal arrivals into Britain amid record numbers of small boat crossings in the English Channel this year.  This time however the US president did not mince his words, suggesting Starmer should potentially involve the military, and warning that illegal migration \"destroys countries from within\". Trump referred to his approach to securing the US border and said the pair had discussed the issue during their private meeting earlier. He added: \"I think your situation is very similar. You have people coming in, and I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use.\" Starmer said the first flight under the migrant returns deal with France taking off earlier, calling it an \"important step forward\" on the small boats issue. An area where the pair were seemingly united was in condemning Russia over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, after Trump said earlier this week said he could impose tougher sanctions on the country if Nato allies meet certain conditions. Starmer condemned recent Russian missile attacks that saw damage to the British Council building in Kyiv, and said the recent actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin were not those of someone who wants peace. The US president said Putin had \"really let me down\", admitting he thought solving the Russia-Ukraine war would be one of the easier conflicts to deal with. He added, however, that he did not regret holding the peace summit in Alaska with Putin a few months ago, and he felt an \"obligation\" to help find an end to the war due to the enormous loss of life in the conflict.  Another potential point of tension was the subject of free speech, after Trump's vice-president JD Vance's scalding attack on European democracies, including the UK, over the issue earlier this year. But asked whether he agreed with Vance and whether the issue remained an important area of disagreement with Starmer, Trump chose not to comment, instead moving to the next question. Starmer promised the UK would protect free speech \"jealously and fiercely,\" calling it one of the country's \"founding values\". But he said free speech had to be balanced against the need for protections, such as protecting children from paedophiles and \"those that peddle suicide\" online.  The state visit has taken place one week after Sir Keir sacked former Labour minister Lord Mandelson as his ambassador to the US over his past friendship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. That had the potential to be awkward for both the prime minister and the US president, who also had a friendship with the now-deceased Epstein before falling out with him in the early 2000s, prior to the late financier's conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Referring to Mandelson as the \"elephant in the room\", Sky News reporter Beth Rigby asked Trump if he had sympathy with the sacked Labour peer.  Despite having shaken hands with Lord Mandelson in the Oval Office earlier this year, Trump relied: \"I don't know him, actually,\" before suggesting Sir Keir would be better placed to speak on the subject.  The prime minister repeated his previous assertion that he had sacked Lord Mandelson after new information came to light about his association with Epstein.

    "summary": "The man was removed on Thursday under the \"one in, one out\" agreement and has arrived in Paris.",
    "text": "The first flight carrying a cross-channel small boat migrant has landed in Paris, under the UK-France agreement.  The man, an Indian national, was removed from the UK on Thursday morning on an Air France plane. It comes a little over a month since the UK and France agreed a year-long \"one in, one out\" pilot scheme of exchanges of migrants in the hope of deterring small boat crossings. Meanwhile, later on Thursday the High Court rejected an attempt to temporarily stop another migrant - an Eritrean man - being removed to France, paving the way for a flight to take off early on Friday morning. The court in London heard the man, who was granted anonymity, was set to be deported from the UK at 06:15 BST on Friday. In a ruling after a three-hour emergency hearing on Thursday evening, Mr Justice Sheldon said there was no legal justification to delay the transport of the man to France. His lawyers had argued that he may have been the victim of trafficking and there had been assurances that the French would properly look after him. The Eritrean man said he fled his home country in 2019 because of forced conscription - and he spent time in Ethiopia, South Sudan and Libya before coming to Europe, and eventually making his way to Dunkirk to try to cross to England - arriving on 6 August. His subsequent asylum claim was refused - as was his account that he should be protected in the UK as a victim of trafficking or slavery after officials concluded he had changed his story and could not be believed. It comes after the government said it would appeal against a High Court decision to temporarily block the deportation of a separate Eritrean man on modern slavery grounds. Reacting to the first migrant being deported under the scheme, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said:  \"This is an important first step to securing our borders.\" \"It sends a message to people crossing in small boats: if you enter the UK illegally, we will seek to remove you\", she added. Later on Thursday, US President Donald Trump was asked at a joint news conference at Chequers what advice he would offer Sir Keir Starmer on border control. \"I told the prime minister I would stop it, and it doesn't matter if you call out the military, it doesn't matter what means you use,\" Trump said. In response, Sir Keir said: \"This is an issue we are taking incredibly seriously, we have struck a number of cooperation deals with other countries because this is a problem right across Europe. \"We struck the returns arrangement with France and notwithstanding the challenges to that scheme that you've seen in the last few days, a flight went off at 06:15 this morning successfully returning someone in that scheme.\" While the Home Office says that more flights are planned in the coming days, it's not clear how many passengers will be booked on to each one because of ongoing legal challenges \u2013 or threats of them. Around 100 men are currently in immigration removal centres near Heathrow under the scheme. Each one was detained after arriving in the UK on a small boat and told they were potentially eligible to be returned to France.  Days later, officials told them that they would be given a departure date \u2013 but it's not clear how many know what that is. The BBC is aware of around 50 men who are being supported by refugee charities \u2013 but as of Thursday morning less than a fifth of them had a formal letter informing them of when they would be sent to France.  Around a similar proportion are said to be lobbying for a reconsideration because they argue they have been victims of slavery and trafficking, regardless of the strength of their claim to be a refugee. Around 5,590 migrants have reached the UK since the scheme came into effect at the start of August. Meanwhile a government appeal has been launched, aimed at limiting the time migrants have to provide evidence to challenge their removal. Further deportation flights are planned this week and into next week, the Home Office said. Initially, it was thought another person would be leaving on a flight on Thursday - but the BBC understand this is now not going to happen. The Home Office also said the first arrivals from France through the new asylum route are expected in the UK in the coming days. \"The UK will always play its part in helping those genuinely fleeing persecution, but this must be done through safe, legal, and managed routes - not dangerous crossings,\" it added. Mahmood earlier vowed to fight \"vexatious, last-minute claims\" after the High Court intervened this week in the case of an Eritrean man who argued, after arrival in the UK by small boat last month, that he was a victim of modern slavery just hours before his flight was due to take off. But the UK's independent anti-slavery commissioner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was \"deeply concerned\" about the home secretary's words. Eleanor Lyons said that suggesting the system was being abused created a \"tool for traffickers to use with those victims that they are exploiting\". The \"one in one out\" deal is intended to act as a deterrent against migrants attempting to make the treacherous English Channel crossing in small boats. It proposes that, for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in the UK will come in return. Under the treaty, the UK can immediately detain anyone who crosses the English Channel and, within around two weeks, agree with the French authorities to return the individual. The aim of the plan is to make people think twice about turning to smugglers because of the risk that they will be sent back.  There is no suggestion from either government that the plan will, on its own, smash the cross-channel trade. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "summary": "A constant of stream of Palestinians flee southwards as Israeli tanks reportedly push further into Gaza's biggest urban centre.",
    "text": "The situation in Gaza City is \"nothing short of cataclysmic\", a UN official has told the BBC, as Israeli tanks and troops continue to advance on the third day of a ground offensive. Olga Cherevko, a spokeswoman for the UN's humanitarian office, said she had seen a constant stream of Palestinians heading south during a recent visit to the city, but that hundreds of thousands remained. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that overwhelmed hospitals were on the brink of collapse because it was being prevented from delivering lifesaving supplies. The Israeli military said its forces were \"dismantling terror infrastructure and eliminating terrorists\" in Gaza City. It has said its objectives are to free the hostages still held by Hamas and defeat up to 3,000 fighters in what it has described as the group's \"main stronghold\". However, the offensive on Gaza's biggest urban area, where one million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month, has drawn widespread international condemnation. The UN and its humanitarian partners have recorded at least 200,000 people crossing from northern to southern Gaza since mid-August, when Israel announced its intention to conquer Gaza City. Around 55,000 have made the journey since Sunday. Cherevko, who works for the UN humanitarian office in the central city of Deir al-Balah, told the BBC she travelled to Gaza City two days ago - a 29km (18 mile) round-trip that took 14 hours. \"The things there, and the scenes on the way to Gaza City, are nothing short of cataclysmic,\" she recalled. \"A constant stream of people [are] crossing from the north to the south, many on foot. Inside Gaza City, it's very crowded still because there are hundreds of thousands of civilians still remaining there.\" She said she also witnessed multiple Israeli strikes \"very close\" to the UN convoy while in Gaza City, adding: \"It was really just a constant hit after hit while we were there.\" On Thursday morning, witnesses told Reuters news agency they had seen Israeli tanks in the northern Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood and the southern neighbourhood of Tal al-Hawa, which have come under heavy bombardment in recent days. They also reported that Israeli forces had blown up remotely driven vehicles laden with explosives in both areas, destroying many houses. Local hospitals said at least 14 people had been killed by Israeli fire across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, including nine in Gaza City. The Israeli military said in a statement that its troops were \"expanding\" their operations in the city, without giving any details about their movements. At the start of the ground assault on Tuesday, the military's chief of staff, Lt Gen Eyal Zamir, told troops to \"intensify the blows against Hamas and to decisively defeat the Gaza City brigade, in order to carry out the most moral and important duty - the return of all the hostages home and the dismantling of Hamas's military and governing capabilities\". Cherevko warned that many people were unable to comply with the Israeli military's order to evacuate to its designated \"humanitarian area\" in the south. \"The expense of moving your belongings, if you are lucky enough to find a vehicle that will move them, is exorbitant. It's not affordable for many people. And that's why many are doing this on foot, with barely a mattress in their hands and maybe a plastic bag.\" And once they arrived there were no guarantees of shelter or safety, she added. \"I spoke to a lot of people who have recently arrived in Deir al-Balah and [the southern city of] Khan Younis. Many of them are sitting on the side of the street, with nothing. They don't have any shelter. They don't know where to go. \"Yesterday, I met a family who had been walking around for four days, trying to find space to sleep and they didn't manage,\" she said. The WHO's chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the Israeli offensive was \"forcing traumatised families into an ever-shrinking area unfit for human dignity\". \"The injured and people with disabilities cannot move to safety, which puts their lives in grave danger,\" he wrote on X. \"Hospitals, already overwhelmed, are on the brink of collapse as escalating violence blocks access and prevents [the] WHO from delivering lifesaving supplies.\" The UN says there are currently about 1,790 in-patient hospital beds for the 2.1 million population of Gaza, resulting in occupancy rates of 180 to 300% across the 17 hospitals that remain partially functional across the territory. Ten of those hospitals are in Gaza City and one is elsewhere in northern Gaza. On Tuesday, al-Rantisi children's hospital in Gaza City - the only specialised paediatric hospital left in the territory - was hit by three Israeli strikes, causing damage to rooftop water tanks, electrical and communication systems and some medical equipment, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Forty patients fled for safety following the attack, while 40 others, including four children in the intensive care and eight newborn babies, remain inside. The Israeli military has not yet commented. The UN Population Fund meanwhile warned that women were being forced to give birth in the streets, without hospitals, doctors or clean water. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 65,141 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry. The ministry says another 435 people have so far died during the war as a result of malnutrition and starvation, including four over the past 24 hours. The army says the attacker was driving a truck transporting humanitarian aid from Jordan. Israel said it was targeting Hezbollah positions, while Lebanon's PM called for pressure on Israel to stop attacks. The Sea follows a boy from the occupied West Bank who wants to visit Tel Aviv to see the sea for the first time. The sight of tanks in Sheikh Radwan has caused widespread alarm among residents, with thousands fleeing south. Israel says its aim is to defeat up to 3,000 Hamas fighters who remain there, but the offensive has drawn international condemnation. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "summary": "MP Zarah Sultana says she is a victim of a \"sexist boys' club\" in row over setting up new left wing party.",
    "text": "Ex-Labour MP Zarah Sultana has accused Jeremy Corbyn of overseeing a \"sexist boys' club\" locking women out of the founding of a new left-wing party the pair announced earlier this year. In a statement on social media, Sultana said she had been sidelined by other members of the party's working group - despite an agreement that she and Corbyn would jointly authorise key steps. Her comments come after Your Party supporters got an email on Thursday offering \u00a355 memberships only for Corbyn to later dismiss it as \"unauthorised\"  - telling supporters he was seeking legal advice. Sultana said she had launched the membership website \"in line with the road map\" set out by the party officials. Before her statement, Sultana had been posting on social media throughout the morning encouraging people to sign up at a cost of \u00a355 for full membership. Sultana had claimed more than 20,000 people had signed up - meaning the new party could have raised more than \u00a31m in a single morning.  In her statement she said: \"My sole motivation has been to safeguard the grassroots involvement that is essential to building this party.  \"Unfortunately, I have been subjected to what can only be described as a sexist boys' club: I have been treated appallingly and excluded completely.  \"They have refused to allow any other women with voting rights on the Working Group, blocking the gender-balanced committee that both Jeremy and I signed up to.\" Before Sultana's comments, Corbyn put out a conflicting statement signed by Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed and Shockat Adam - members of the Independent Alliance of MPs who are founding the new party. Sultana's name was conspicuously missing from the list. The message to supporters on Thursday morning claimed an \"unauthorised email\" had been sent promoting a membership portal under a new domain name. They urged backers to ignore the message and cancel any direct debits that may have been set up. Sultana defended her decision to set up the membership portal, insisting it was \"in line with the roadmap set out to members on Monday and is a safe, secure, legitimate portal for the party\". She claimed she had set up the site to allow supporters to \"continue to engage and organise\", and that membership funds were held by a company set up by the party to safeguard money until November's founding conference. Sultana also went on to raise concerns that long-time Corbyn ally Karie Murphy and her associates had been handed \"sole financial control of members' money and sole constitutional control over our conference\". She called for Corbyn to publish all party structures arguing only transparency would \"restore hope for our members, and ensure nothing like this can ever happen again\". \"This party is bigger than any one person,\" she said, \"and we owe it to the movement to uphold its democratic and socialist foundations.\" On social media, some left-wingers raged that the party fragmenting so early into its formation had put them off joining. Guardian journalist Owen Jones, who has championed the new party, warned that if the split drags on \"people will switch off and just bet everything on the Greens\". The row is the latest falling out at the top of the new group that has yet to be named or hold an annual conference.  In July, Sultana announced that she was leaving Labour and starting a new party with Corbyn, a move that took the former Labour leader and others involved in the project by surprise. The pair also disagreed over the name of the party. In July, Sultana insisted it would not be called Your Party - saying she instead favoured The Left Party - only for Corbyn to hint the name could stay. The final decision is to be put to a vote by supporters. Despite the bumpy start the party began to build momentum, signing up more than 750,000 supporters - under the placeholder name of Your Party. Earlier this week, Your Party emailed supporters saying membership would open by the end of September and draft party rules and policy positions would soon be published. This would be followed by national assembles in October and an online vote on the new name for the party. In November, the party's founding conference will be held.

    "summary": "They located this key area of function by recording the brain activity of running rats.",
    "text": "Scientists have for the first time located the \"mileage clock\" inside a brain - by recording the brain activity of running rats. Letting them loose inside a small, rat-sized arena, the researchers recorded from a part of their brains that is known to be important in navigation and memory. They found that cells there \"fired\" in a pattern that looked like a mileage clock - ticking with every few steps the animal travelled. A further experiment, where human volunteers walked through a scaled up version of this rat navigation test, suggested that the human brain has the same clock. This study, published in the journal Current Biology, is the first to show that the regular ticking of \"grid cells\", as they are known, is directly connected to the ability to correctly gauge the distance we've travelled. \"Imagine walking between your kitchen and living room,\" said lead researcher Prof James Ainge from the University of St Andrews. \"[These cells] are in the part of the brain that provides that inner map \u2013 the ability to put yourself in the environment in your mind.\" This study provides insight into exactly how that internal map in our brains works - and what happens when it goes awry. If you disrupt the ticking of that mileage clock by changing the environment, both rats and humans start getting their distance estimation wrong. In real life, this happens in darkness, or when fog descends when we're out on a hike. It suddenly becomes much more difficult to estimate how far we have travelled, because our mileage counter stops working reliably.  To investigate this experimentally, researchers trained rats to run a set distance in a rectangular arena - rewarding the animals with a treat - a piece of chocolate cereal - when they ran the correct distance and then returned to the start. When the animals ran the correct distance, the mileage-counting cells in their brains fired regularly - approximately every 30cm a rat travelled. \"The more regular that firing pattern was, the better the animals were at estimating the distance they had to go to get that treat,\" explained Prof Ainge. The researchers were able to record the brain's mileage clock counting the distance the rat had moved. Crucially, when the scientists altered the shape of the rat arena, that regular firing pattern became erratic and the rats struggled to work out how far they needed to go before they returned to the start for their chocolate treat. \"It's fascinating,\" said Prof Ainge. \"They seem to show this sort of chronic underestimation. There's something about the fact that the signal isn't regular that means they stop too soon.\" The scientists likened this to visual landmarks suddenly disappearing in the fog.  \"Obviously it's harder to navigate in fog, but maybe what we what people don't appreciate is that it also impairs our ability to estimate distance.\" To test this in humans, the researchers scaled up their rat-sized experiment. They built a 12m x 6m arena in the university's student union and asked volunteers to carry out the same task as the rats - walking a set distance, then returning to the start. Just like rats, human participants were consistently able to estimate the distance correctly when they were in a symmetrical, rectangular box. But when the scientists moved the walls of their purpose-built arena to change its shape, the participants started making mistakes. Prof Ainge explained: \"Rats and humans learn the distance estimation task really well, then, when you change the environment in the way that we know distorts the signal in the rats, you see exactly the same behavioural pattern in humans.\"  As well as revealing something fundamental about how our brains allow us to navigate, the scientists say the findings could help to diagnose Alzheimer's Disease. \"The specific brain cells we're recording from are in one of the very first areas that's affected in Alzheimer's,\" explained Prof Ainge. \"People have already created [diagnostic] games that you can play on your phone, for example, to test navigation. We'd be really interested in trying something similar, but specifically looking at distance estimation.\" To hear more on this story listen to Victoria Gill on the BBC's Inside Science.

    "summary": "He said his team had considered \"alternative offences\" but concluded \"none were suitable\".",
    "text": "England and Wales's chief prosecutor has said no \"outside pressure\" played a part in his organisation's decision to drop charges against two British men accused of spying for China. Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions who leads the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said his team had considered \"alternative offences\" but concluded \"none were suitable\". The case against Christopher Cash, a former parliamentary researcher, and Christopher Berry, a teacher, was dropped on Monday  prompting fury from the UK government, opposition parties and Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle. Cash and Berry had denied the allegations. Beijing called the claims \"malicious slander\". The two men were accused of gathering and providing information prejudicial to the safety and interests of the state between 28 December 2021 and 3 February 2023. But on Monday at the Old Bailey, the court heard that the CPS had determined the evidence it had gathered did not meet the threshold to go to trial. The pair were due to appear at Woolwich Crown Court from 6 October. Mr Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), said the independence of his team was \"completely respected within Whitehall and government\" and he could give his \"own assurance\" that there had been no outside pressure. Parkinson's comments came in a letter to shadow home secretary Chris Philp who had asked whether the CPS had been \"politically pressured directly or indirectly by any representative of the government\". Parkinson indicated that one factor in securing a conviction would have entailed proving that China was an \"enemy\" as stated in the Official Secrets Act 1911. \"To secure a conviction, the prosecution must prove that a person, for any purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of the state, communicated information to another person which is calculated to be, might be, or is intended to be directly or indirectly useful to an \"enemy\",\" he said. The law has since been changed with the National Security Act 2023 which Mr Parkinson said contained \"more extensive provisions to deal with espionage and those who are acting on behalf of foreign powers\". The CPS decision was criticised by the Home Office and the prime minister's official spokesman who said it was \"extremely disappointing\" the individuals would not face trial.  Speaker Lindsay Hoyle told the Commons: \"I am a very unhappy speaker with what has happened. The fact that it has taken two years, until today, for somebody to withdraw this case is not good enough.\" Security minister Dan Jarvis said he was \"extremely disappointed\" that there would be no trial and the government remained \"gravely concerned about the threat of Chinese espionage\".

    "summary": "The police say the hack caused \"significant disruption\" and \"millions in losses\" for TfL.",
    "text": "Two teenagers have been charged in connection with a massive cyber attack which caused Transport for London (TfL) months of disruption. The National Crime Agency (NCA) says it believes the hack - which began on 31 August last year - was carried out by members of the cyber-criminal group, Scattered Spider. Thalha Jubair, 19, from east London, and Owen Flowers, 18, from Walsall in the West Midlands, were arrested at their home addresses on Tuesday by the NCA and City of London Police. Both appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on Thursday afternoon charged with conspiring together to commit unauthorised acts against TfL, under the Computer Misuse Act. They have been remanded in custody to appear at Southwark Crown Court at a later date. TfL says the hack caused it \u00a339m of damage and disruption. The hack disrupted TfL services for three months. Whilst trains, buses and other transport was unaffected, many TfL online services and connected information boards went offline as part of the attack. TfL wrote to around 5,000 customers to say there may have been unauthorised access to their personal information such as bank account numbers and sort codes. Data including names, emails and home addresses were accessed. Deputy Director Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said: \"Today's charges are a key step in what has been a lengthy and complex investigation. \"This attack caused significant disruption and millions in losses to TfL, part of the UK's critical national infrastructure.\"  The court heard that the TfL hack occurred while Mr Flowers was on bail. After he was arrested, detectives found evidence he had also targeted US healthcare companies. Mr Flowers has been charged with conspiring, with others, to infiltrate and damage the networks of SSM Health Care Corporation and attempting to do the same to Sutter Health.  When Mr Flowers appeared in court, he wore a grey hoodie with \"off the grid\" written on it. Mr Jubair sat next to him, wearing a black hoodie and black glasses. Neither man spoke to each other during the proceedings.  TfL's 25,000 staff were forced to report into offices around the capital to have their identities verified as part of the large and lengthy recovery operation. In a statement on Thursday afternoon, it said: \"We welcome this announcement by the National Crime Agency that two people have now been charged in relation to the cyber incident which impacted our operations last year.\" Earlier this year, the NCA warned of an increasing threat from cyber criminal gangs based in the UK and other English-speaking countries, such as Scattered Spider. Oscar-winning director Danny Boyle has an event planned for the May Bank holiday weekend next year. Police call the shooting at the north London park a \"deeply distressing incident\". Jack Shepherd was released last year, but has been recalled for breaching his licence conditions.

    "text": "Author Sally Rooney said she did not travel to the UK to collect a book prize this week as she was concerned she may be arrested over her support of British group Palestine Action. The Irish novelist has been donating money to the group, which was proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK government in July, after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged two military aircraft earlier this year. Palestine Action has been targeting arms companies since war broke out in Gaza in 2023. Rooney, 34, who won a Sky Arts award for novel Intermezzo, said in a statement read out for her at the ceremony: \"I'm advised that I can no longer safely enter the UK without potentially facing arrest\". The statement, read by Rooney's publisher Alex Bowler, also said: \"I wish that I could be with you this evening to accept the honour in person,\" adding that she was showing \"support for non-violent anti-war protest\". \"In that context, I want to thank you all the more warmly for honouring my work tonight, and to reiterate my belief in the dignity and beauty of all human life, and my solidarity with the people of Palestine,\" it also said. Rooney said in August she was using the proceeds from her four books and income from the BBC TV adaptations of Normal People and Conversations with Friends to support Palestine Action. She is not currently working with the BBC on any upcoming projects and has never been a member of staff. Last week, 890 people were arrested at a demonstration against the ban on Palestine Action in London on Saturday according to the Metropolitan Police. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said last week: Supporting Palestine and supporting a proscribed terrorist group are not the same thing.\" She also said she \"backed officers\" who had arrested those supporting the group.

    "summary": "Planning approvals for new homes were at their lowest on record during Labour\u2019s first year in office, figures show",
    "text": "The number of planning approvals for new homes in England is unacceptable, the new housing secretary has said, after official data showed permission for building homes fell to a record low during Labour's first year in office. Fewer than 29,000 projects were granted permission by councils in the year ending June 2025 - striking a blow to the government's promise to deliver 1.5 million homes by the next election. Steve Reed, who has taken over from Angela Rayner as housing secretary, said fixing the planning system \"won't happen overnight\". Conservative shadow housing secretary Sir James Cleverly said that Labour had \"promised to 'build, build, build' but their flagship planning reforms clearly aren't working\". You can see the figures for your local area in BBC Verify's housing tracker. About 7,000 applications for housing were granted permission between April and June 2025 - the lowest three-month figure since records began in 1979 and an 8% fall on the same three months of 2024. An application can be either \"minor\" for fewer than 10 homes or \"major\" for 10 or more. The data shows that both the number of approvals and the overall number of decisions taken by councils have fallen. But councils are approving a larger proportion of the ones they handle. Around three-quarters of applications decided were approved in the year to June 2025, up from 71% the year before. Separate data from housing contractor Glenigan suggests 221,000 individual homes were granted permission in the year to June, down from 237,000 the year to June 2024. Labour promised in its election manifesto to deliver 1.5 million homes in England by the next general election. To get to that, there would need to be an average of about 300,000 new homes per year. Mr Reed said: \"These figures are unacceptable. I will leave no stone unturned to build 1.5 million homes, so families have the key to home ownership in their hands.\" His plans include an overhaul of the Building Safety Regulator's performance and working with the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, to unlock house building in the capital. This is on top of reforms already announced, such as housing targets for local councils that were set last December. The government has also pledged a \u00a339 billion investment over 10 years to build hundreds of thousands of new social and affordable homes. Government figures used in BBC Verify's housing tracker suggest the number of new homes receiving their first energy performance certificate (EPC) fell during Labour's first year in office, with ministers blaming the slowdown on the previous Conservative government. EPCs are a leading indicator of new homes in between the releases of annual statistics. Government data is not available on applications received for housing but Planning Portal, which people use to apply to their local council for permission, reported a big rise in the number of new homes requested. Geoff Keal from Planning Portal said that while applications through their service had gone up, getting to the decision stage can take several months. \"Backlogs mean approvals for this wave of applications may not appear until later in the year,\" he said. Housing market analyst Neal Hudson, of BuiltPlace, said: \"Labour hit the ground running with their housing policies last year but the issue is they were trying to fix the wrong problem. \"Housebuilders and developers will not plan for and build homes if there's no one to buy them. Unfortunately that's the case given current house price levels and mortgage rates, while the government's affordable homes programme is underwhelming given the aspirations for 1.5 million.\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

    "text": "This video can not be played Hodgkinson and Hunter Bell ease into 800m semi-finals Great Britain's Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson began her pursuit of a first world title by cruising through to the semi-finals of the women's 800m in Tokyo. Hodgkinson is the gold-medal favourite after running a world-leading time on her return to action in August, despite enduring a 376-day wait to make her competitive return following last summer's Games. Two hamstring tears later, she secured back-to-back wins in her only two pre-championship races in August. Returning to the stadium where she won Olympic silver as a teenager four years ago, the 23-year-old controlled her heat to reach Friday's semi-finals. There, she will be joined by training partner Georgia Hunter Bell as the pair target a spectacular British one-two in the event. \"I don't like the rounds, they feel awful, they are awful. I just really wanted to enjoy being back in the stadium. It's so nice to be here,\" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport. \"It wasn't pretty or dominant, but it's nice to be safely through. It's been a long week waiting around. Whoever put the 800m last, thank you. \"I've just been looking forward to getting out here, at one point I didn't even know if I'd be here. It definitely means a lot, round by round I'm hoping it goes my way. \"It would mean even more than last year [to win]. I'm just trying to embrace it all.\" Hodgkinson won her heat in a comfortable one minute 59.79 seconds - a time more than five seconds slower than her British record. Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Hunter Bell, who chose to switch focus to the shorter of the middle-distance events in pursuit of another global podium, also began with victory, clocking 1:58.82. Hunter Bell told BBC Sport: \"We have been out in Japan for a long time, so it felt like Christmas morning getting out on track.  \"Doing the 800m is the right decision. I feel like I have really got something to show - I have a high ranking and with my team-mate this was the year to do it.\" Gold medal threats remain in the shape of Kenya's reigning champion Mary Moraa, Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and in-form Swiss athlete Audrey Werro. However, British team-mate Jemma Reekie missed out after placing fifth in her heat. This video can not be played McLaughlin-Levrone wins 400m gold Great Britain's Amber Anning finished fifth in the women's 400m final, in which American hurdles star Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone went close to breaking a 40-year record in claiming a stunning gold. McLaughlin-Levrone, a two-time Olympic and world 400m hurdles champion, hinted that she could threaten German Marita Koch's controversial 1985 record of 47.60 seconds by breaking Sanya Richards-Ross' United States record in the semi-finals.  In wet conditions at Japan's National Stadium, the 26-year-old 400m hurdles record holder clocked the second-fastest 400m flat time in history with 47.78.  World indoor champion Anning, 24, replicated her top-five placing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, running a season's best 49.36. This video can not be played Hughes and Lyles reach 200m final Britain's Zharnel Hughes, Dina Asher-Smith and Amy Hunt each reached the finals of their respective 200m events. Hughes, unable to make the 100m final after winning bronze in 2023, secured his place in the medal race as he followed three-time defending champion Noah Lyles across the line in 19.95 seconds. Lyles produced a statement performance in his favoured event. Having already established a significant advantage over his semi-final competition, the American did not ease up and crossed the line in a world-leading time of 19.51. Hunt ran a personal best 22.08 to follow two-time defending champion Shericka Jackson into the women's 200m final from their heat. Dina Asher-Smith qualified in second in her heat, behind American 100m champion Melissa Jefferson-Wooden. But Daryll Neita was unable to make it a British trio in to the final as she finished fourth.

Pattison could only finish fifth in a race featuring Olympic medallists Marco Arop and Djamel Sedjati. Hannah Nuttall reached Saturday's women's 5,000m final by finishing seventh in her heat in 14:48.09, but Melissa Courtney-Bryant and Innes FitzGerald missed out.

    "text": "After staying overnight in Windsor Castle, US President Donald Trump bid farewell to the King and Queen. \"He's a great gentleman and a great King,\" the US president told the waiting media. Queen Camilla, King Charles, President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump posed for a final group picture on the final day of the state visit. Unlike Wednesday, neither the Queen nor the first lady wore exuberant hats. The first lady had a final round of engagements in Windsor, including a visit to the Royal Library and Queen Mary's Dolls' House with the Queen. The dolls' house was built between 1921 and 1924 for Queen Mary and designed by the British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. President Trump then headed to Chequers to meet Sir Keir Starmer, making the short journey from Windsor Castle by the Marine One helicopter.   A car entourage was ready to greet the president and take him to the prime minister's country house. Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Lady Victoria Starmer gave President Trump a warm welcome, showing him around the residence ahead of their bilateral meeting. Inside Chequers, the US President viewed the Sir Winston Churchill archives alongside the UK Prime Minister, before engaging in bilateral talks. The Princess of Wales and the US first lady joined 20 Squirrel Scouts, the youngest group in the Scout Association, who were taking part in nature activities in Frogmore Gardens on the Windsor Castle estate to earn their Go Wild badges. Later, Starmer and Trump attended a business reception hosted by the UK Chancellor. They signed a new technology partnership, which Starmer said would see billions flowing \"both ways of the Atlantic\". A joint news conference took place that afternoon, prior to the President and First Lady's departure for the US. The President and first lady were honoured with a spectacular aerial display by the British Army's Red Devils to commemorate their historic state visit. The president and PM held a joint news conference before taking questions from journalists on a variety of issues, including the war in Ukraine, Gaza and border security.  The pair spoke at the conclusion of Trump's state visit to the UK. At the end of the news conference, which covered a wide range of topics, the president and first lady posed for photographs with Sir Keir Starmer and his wife, Victoria, before making their way to London Stansted Airport by helicopter, where they boarded Air Force One for their journey back to the US.

    "summary": "The event is as much about diplomacy as it is about fine dining.",
    "text": "Beneath gilded portraits and suits of armour in Windsor Castle, 160 guests wined and dined at a lavish banquet to fete US President Donald Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the UK on Wednesday evening. Along with the impeccable table settings, three-course meal and custom cocktail, who was there and, just as importantly, who was seated next to who is carefully planned, since the event is as much about diplomacy as it is about fine dining. This year's guest list was conspicuously missing screen stars or celebrity faces, with not even royal perennials like Sir David Beckham or Sir Elton John attending. Instead, the list was mostly royals, tech and finance executives, and politicos from both sides of the Atlantic. From Trump's seat of honour at the centre of the table, next to his host King Charles III, those up and down the table ranged from lesser-known but influential White House players to professional golfers. Here were some notable guests - and their neighbours at the table. The table leaned towards power, wealth and influence, including Apple's boss Tim Cook, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, OpenAi's Sam Altman, Blackstone's Stephen Schwarzman and - still powerful after all these years, Fox News owner Rupert Murdoch.  The last is a surprising invitee given the fact Trump is suing one of his newspapers for billions over claims he wrote a note framed by a drawing of a naked woman to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Less surprising perhaps is that Murdoch, owner of The Sun and The Times, was sat next to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's chief political spin doctor Morgan McSweeney. In purely financial terms however, Murdoch's Newscorp is small fry. The others between them run companies worth nearly 10 trillion dollars - four times the value of the entire UK economy.  US business royalty sat down with UK royalty and served up a \u00a3150 billon investment into the UK over the coming years.  Over half of that (\u00a390 billion) is coming from private equity giant Blackstone - little wonder that boss Stephen Schwarzman was seated next to Sir Keir.  But what do these benefactors want in return? Abolishing the UK's digital services tax, watering down the online safety act? No and no, insists the government, who says it sees the relationship akin to the one we share on defence and intelligence.  As the Ukraine war has demonstrated, Europe is heavily dependent on the US for those things.  Some have described this as an invasion rather than investment, with former Deputy PM and ex-Meta employee Sir Nick Clegg warning that the UK could become a vassal state creating new dependencies on a handful of US companies.  For a government and country that is in desperate need of investment and growth, you want to be first in line when it's being dished out - and the UK does appear to be at the front of the queue. A bulk of the table - nearly two dozen seats - were taken up by Trump's camp, including his wife, daughter, son-in-law, and a slew of senior members of his administration covering everything from foreign policy to AI.  He was of course joined by his wife, Melania Trump, whose nameplate simply read \"Mrs Trump\". She was seated across from her husband, in between Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales, William, while Catherine, the Princess of Wales, was next to President Trump. Secretary of State Marco Rubio scored a prime spot next to the King, with Lady Victoria Starmer, not her husband, on his other side. Tiffany Trump, fourth child of the president, was the only one of Trump's children to attend the state banquet this time. On the last state visit in 2019, she was one of four children to come. She has been less involved in the Trump administrations than her older siblings, but some like Ivanka Trump have taken a step back in his second term.  Tiffany's husband Michael Boulos also attended. He is no stranger to London, having studied in the city. He does not hold a role in the Trump administration, but the president picked his father Massad Boulos as a key advisor, and the younger Boulos was placed in a prominent seat beside the Princess of Wales. Steve Witkoff, a real estate mogul turned Trump's special envoy who is playing a pivotal role in foreign policy on the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, likely found lots to discuss with his neighbour Jonathan Powell, Starmer's National Security Adviser. Susan Wiles, White House Chief of Staff, was Trump's campaign manager in the 2024 election. He called her the \"ice maiden\" who operates mostly \"in the back\", but she is known as one of the most feared political operatives in the US. She was seated next to someone with another important but behind-the-scenes role - private secretary to the King, Sir Clive Alderton. Another apt pairing was David Sacks, the White House's AI and crypto tsar, next to Demis Hassabis, CEO and co-founder of Google's DeepMind, a British-American AI firm. King Charles was seated next to his guest of honour Trump and Rubio, while the King's daughter-in-law the Princess of Wales was on Trump's opposite side. Queen Camilla was across the table, next to the First Lady, but more interestingly, also flanked by the US Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. Sitting next to the First Lady, the Prince of Wales could discuss more local matters with his other neighbour, Paula Reynolds, chairwoman of National Grid. The Princess Royal, Anne, who is known for her love of horses, was sitting next to racehorse trainer John Gosden. On her other side was the US ambassador to the UK Warren Stephens, who hosted Trump and the First Lady at his residence in Regents Park the first night they arrived in the UK, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves at his opposite elbow. Other senior royals were seated next to White House powerbrokers. Princess Anne's husband Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence sat next to Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and homeland security advisor Stephen Miller. Beside the Duke of Gloucester, the late Queen Elizabeth II's cousin, was Dan Scavino, White House deputy chief of staff. The Duchess of Gloucester was seated next to James Blair, deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Mrs Trump's visit to the Scouts came after she joined Queen Camilla on a tour of Windsor Castle's royal library and to see the Queen Mary's Dolls House - before inspecting some of the miniatures made especially for the world's largest dollhouse. At the same time, the US president travelled to Chequers, the prime minister's grace-and-favour residence in Buckinghamshire, for diplomatic talks. The 20 Squirrel Scouts had been taking part in nature activities within the gardens of Frogmore House to earn their Go Wild badges. Chief Scout Dwayne Fields told the BBC he chatted throughout the event with the First Lady and Princess of Wales. \"It was a great morning for all involved, particularly for the young people involved,\" he said. \"The setting was grand and in all fairness the two guests we had were very special.\" Mr Fields said Melania and Kate were both \"very personable\" and spent a lot of time with the young people who took part in drawing and other activities. \"Having the princess there, our joint president, alongside the first lady of the United States, is going to be something very special for them in years to come when they understand the true magnitude of what has just happened,\" he added. \"I think it is really important to say they both strongly believe in what we do within the scouts movement and this was a great opportunity for us here, the spiritual home of the Scouts where it all began, to showcase scouting to the US.\" Earlier, during their perusal of Windsor Castle's attractions, the Queen and the first lady shared a smile and a chuckle as they inspected some of the tiny books, including The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson and A Recipe Fit for a Queen by the Queen's son, Tom Parker Bowles. Many of the books - such as Dame Jacqueline Wilson's The House Mouse and Music for a Dolls' House - were made for the 100th anniversary of Queen Mary's Dolls' House. The Queen, an avid advocate of children's literature, also showed some of Windsor's full-size books and historical prints. While the two toured the royal library, schoolchildren created their own miniature books with colouring pencils.  Designed by British architect Sir Edwin Lutyens in the 1920s, the Queen Mary Doll's House is perhaps the most famous of its kind in the world, boasting a fully stocked wine cellar, working lifts, electricity and even running water. The scale replica of an Edwardian residence was built for King George V's consort as a gift from the nation after World War One. At the time, it took more than 1,500 leading artists and craftspeople, including Faberge and Cartier, who worked for three years to complete the project. Other miniature marvels inside the structure include a tiny grand piano, the Crown Jewels and a 1920s-era vacuum cleaner. Since 1925, it has sat in Windsor Castle, in a room Sir Edwin also designed, attracting around half a million visitors each year. After spending time with the Princess of Wales, the first lady joined her husband at Chequers; from there after diplomatic talks they will both return to Air Force One for their departure back to the US. The events cap off a two-day state visit that has included expansive displays of pageantry and a lavish banquet in which King Charles and Trump both remarked on the close relationship between the UK and US.  The US president's unprecedented second state visit was accompanied by the announcement of US technology firm investments in the UK potentially worth up to \u00a3150bn. Trump's visit to Chequers will conclude with a news conference, in which topics - including state recognition for Palestine and the sacking of the UK's ambassador to the US over his relationship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein - are likely to be raised. RAF pilot Sqn Ldr Denis Lowery repatriated the body of the Duke of Windsor after his death in 1972. The US president was inspired from an early age by his mother's love for the Royal Family and the fascination has endured. The Princess Royal attends the ceremony which saw Household Cavalry standards handed over. Catherine paid a visit to Marina Mill in Cuxton to celebrate the British texile industry.

    "text": "The UK government says it has secured \u00a3150bn worth of US investment which it hopes will create 7,600 jobs. The announcement came on the day that US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer signed an agreement dubbed the \"Tech Prosperity Deal\" which sees firms such as Microsoft and Google pledging to spend billions in the UK. It is part of a wider plan by the UK to deepen economic ties with the US. However, some industries, such as steel, have been dealt a blow with a proposed deal to cut tariffs shelved. Several big drugs companies, such as AstraZeneca, have also halted investment plans, claiming the UK is an \"increasingly challenging\" country to do business in.  The vast majority of the \u00a3150bn investment - \u00a390bn - will come from Blackstone over the next decade, although how most of this money will be spent has yet to be decided. The US private equity firm announced in June it would spend \u00a3370bn across Europe over 10 years. The technology deal will see the UK and US co-operate in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing and nuclear power. Microsoft has pledged to spend \u00a322bn in the UK over the next four years, while Google is to invest \u00a35bn over the next two years to expand an existing data centre in Hertfordshire. Starmer said the investments were \"a testament to Britain's economic strength and a bold signal that our country is open, ambitious, and ready to lead\". The PM is keen to make the UK a destination for US investment in an attempt to boost Britain's economy. While it is hoped the investments will generate thousands of jobs in the years ahead, it comes at a time when domestic businesses appear to be slowing investment due to higher running costs.  The government says 7,600 jobs will be created by the investments, but over the year to August the number of people on UK payrolls has fallen by an estimated 127,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. Vacancies were down by 119,000 (14%) in June to August 2025 from the level of a year ago. Many firms have blamed increasing costs, such as having to pay more in National Insurance and the minimum wage, as reasons for slowing investment. In recent days, pharmaceutical companies have highlighted other challenges to investing in the UK. US giant Merck rowed back on a plan to invest \u00a31bn after blaming successive governments for undervaluing innovative medicines. Instead, it will move research to the US. AstraZeneca then paused plans to invest \u00a3200m at a Cambridge research site, a project expected to create 1,000 jobs. It has also switched investment to the US. Meanwhile, money is also flowing from UK firms to the US. In the investment announcement, the government pointed to drugs giant GSK investing nearly \u00a322bn in R&D and manufacturing in the US over a five-year period. Business and Trade Secretary Peter Kyle said the planned investment reflected growing confidence in the UK's industrial strategy. \"These record-breaking investments will create thousands of high-quality jobs across the UK,\" he said. But former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, who also used to be Facebook's president of global affairs, told the BBC's Today programme that the investment was \"crumbs from the Silicon Valley table\". He called for \"some perspective\" to be applied to the \"hype\", and that the deal did not solve the UK's \"perennial achilles heel\", which was that British start-ups tended to end up in the US as they seek investment. \"Not only do we import all their technology, we export all our good people and good ideas as well,\" he said. He said the UK had to learn to \"stand more on our own two feet\", rather than \"cling on to Uncle Sam's coat tails\". Microsoft, Google and Nvidia have announced investments as part of a \u00a331bn UK-US \"Tech Prosperity Deal\".\n  An agreement to reduce tariffs on UK steel to zero in short order was welcomed with some fanfare in July. The BBC's Political Editor Chris Mason and North America Editor Sarah Smith discuss what's at stake for both sides during the trip. Months of preparations have gone into this state visit - but the Lord Mandelson question is not the only concern troubling insiders.

    "summary": "This moment has parallels with other periods of discord in US history, but it is more complicated than simply repeating them.",
    "text": "It has been a brutal week in America and I'm not the only one wondering whether the country can pull itself out of this spiral of hatred and violence. After one of the most searing assassinations in US history, the governor of Utah pleaded for Americans to turn down the political temperature.  But hardly anyone that I've spoken to since Charlie Kirk's death thinks that will be the path the country will choose. Not anytime soon, at least. Recent history is full of examples where America has chosen not to come together after a tragedy. It didn't happen 14 years ago after a Democratic congresswoman was shot in the head in Arizona. Nor eight years ago, when a Republican congressman was shot during baseball practice. Americans didn't even come together in the face of a global pandemic. In fact, Covid made divisions worse. The reason is simple, yet hard to change. The incentives that fuel American political life reward the people and platforms that turn up the heat, not those who dial tensions down. Around the country, you're more likely to get elected to political office if you run on policies and rhetoric that appeal to your political base, rather than the political middle (it's the depressing byproduct of gerrymandering - the original sin behind America's dysfunctional, divided politics). Equally, in the media, people who opine about politics are rewarded for being more extreme and stoking outrage \u2014 that's the way to get more eyeballs and, ultimately, more advertising dollars. This incentive structure is what makes Utah Governor Spencer Cox something of an American exception. After Charlie Kirk was killed, he urged Americans to \"log off, turn off, touch grass, hug a family member, go out and do good in the community\". He sounded so sane, so wholesome - an effort, in a sea of division, at reconciliation. Division and political violence are not new phenomena in America. Some 160 years ago, the country went to war with itself and it has never really stopped. Over a period of five years in the 1960s, a US president was killed and then his brother was killed while campaigning to become president. In that same period, two of the nation's most prominent civil rights leaders were assassinated too. In the 1970s, President Gerald Ford was shot at on two separate occasions. In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan was struck by a bullet while walking to his limousine. And of course, just last year Trump was the victim of a failed attempt on his life by a gunman in Pennsylvania \u2014 and a second alleged attempt by a gunman in Florida, whose trial began the week Kirk was killed. What makes this era so different from the 1960s and 70s, though, is what Governor Cox is worried about.  While he has carefully steered away from saying things that would further divide Americans, he hasn't been so gentle with the social media companies that he clearly blames for this tragedy. \"I believe that social media has played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years,\" Cox said in an interview on Sunday. He went on to say that \"cancer\" was likely too weak a word for what it has done to American society. Most tech companies have stayed quiet in their official capacities. However, Elon Musk, billionaire boss of X, has weighed in, claiming that the \"radical left celebrated the cold-blooded murder of Charlie Kirk,\" and adding, \"unity is impossible with evil fanatics who celebrate murder\". He has also posted about the impact of social media, arguing: \"While at times the discussion on X can become negative, it's still good that there is a discussion happening.\" The pitfalls of this system that blends social media with politics concerns even those who are the most passionate about politics, regardless of who they support. Earlier this week, Kaitlin Griffiths, a 19-year-old who is the president of Utah State University's chapter of Charlie Kirk's organisation, Turning Point USA, put it plainly: \"Social media is definitely a really difficult thing for our society. \"You can't even hold a conversation with somebody who doesn't agree with your political beliefs \u2014 and I just think that's honestly tragic.\" Tragic and ironic, since Kirk saw himself as a champion of free speech, even as his critics often disagreed with that framing. His death though may push the country further from civil discourse. Within days of Kirk's death, the country's political camps had already retreated to opposing narratives. Many on the left are eager to explore the ways that Kirk's killer might have been radicalised by internet subcultures and group chats. Many on the right prefer to unpack whether the suspect was part of a left-wing conspiracy. Neither group seems particularly keen to prioritise reconciliation or healing. The reality is that those who study extremism believe that left-right may not even be the most helpful way to look at the division of this current moment. \"It's better to look at what's causing people to be ungovernable,\" says Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who specialises in polarised democracies. \"It does take a desire to turn down the temperature\u2026 [and] requires people to have a little more courage than they're showing. \"I think it is more useful to focus on how we as a society turn a page and open a new chapter, because this is like a bad marriage. And like a bad marriage, you can only lose by pointing fingers.\" As for the question of whether America can break the hold of the algorithms that stoke the divisions, that would take a leader of enormous strength with an equally enormous commitment to reconciliation. \"I'm not sure how we pull out of this,\" the politics writer David Drucker told me. \"It would help if both parties - and by parties I mean 'parties' not just political figures - agree to stop the recriminations and just say 'stop'.\" \"Usually only a president can facilitate that. Absent both sides agreeing there are certain lines that shouldn't be crossed, or absent the next president doing so, I'm not sure how we get there.\" Trump is not that type of president. He often seems at his strongest, politically, when he has an adversary to fight against.  My understanding is that Trump does believe that people on the left want to destroy his Maga movement. And since Kirk's death, he has taken a very different tone from the governor of Utah. \"I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less,\" he said, when asked how the nation can be fixed. \"The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don't want to see crime... The radicals on the left are the problem.\" And he went further in his Oval Office remarks following Kirk's killing: \"Radical left political violence has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\" The framing by the president - that this was not just the deed of a twisted individual but of the radical left more broadly - is being echoed by other White House officials. \"With God as my witness, we are going to use every resource we have... to identify, disrupt, dismantle and destroy these networks,\" said Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff.  \"It will happen, and we will do it in Charlie's name.\" However, a number of studies into politically-motivated killings and violence in the US - over several decades - suggest that more cases were carried out by people with \"right-wing\" ideologies than with \"left-wing\" ones, though more data is likely necessary to draw a firm conclusion. Some people I've spoken to point to bleak times in US history as a source of comfort. \"Few periods in America have been more politically bleak or violent than the years [in the 1960s and early 1970s] shaped by Vietnam and Watergate,\" former Republican congressman, turned influential TV host, Joe Scarborough told me.  \"But the country moved forward, celebrated its bicentennial, and moved beyond its violent divides. It will do so again.\" Also among the optimists I spoke to was Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock of Georgia, one of the country's most senior black officials. He condemned political violence as the most \"anti-democratic\" act, but also reminded me of the progress America has made on issues like race. \"The story of any family is always more complicated than the stories we tell ourselves at the family reunion,\" he told me.  \"My father had to give up his seat [on a bus] while wearing his soldier's uniform to a teenager, but I now sit in a Senate seat.\" Their hope is heartening - but I still don't see a clear path out. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about a conversation I had earlier this year with historian and filmmaker Ken Burns, as America prepares to celebrate the 250th anniversary of its founding. \"People say history repeats itself,\" Burns told me. \"It never has.\" Burns instead prefers a quote that many have attributed to the writer Mark Twain: \"History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes.\" In other words, even if the present looks like the past \u2014 things never happen the same way twice. This moment of tension feels like it rhymes with so many other periods of discord in American history, but it isn't quite repeating them.  Yes, American history is full of anger and conflict \u2014 but I'm not sure this country's social and political systems were always so quick to reward the companies and people who stoke those emotions. Meanwhile the United States will get weaker, not greater.  Former Defence Secretary Bob Gates once told me that the three greatest threats to America's national security were a rising China, a declining Russia and the country's own internal divisions. America's adversaries certainly know how much its divisions damage this superpower. They work hard online to drive people further apart. And Americans make it easy for them.

    "summary": "The actor says his latest film, One Battle After Another, \"holds a mirror up to society\".",
    "text": "One Battle After Another, the film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn, has been 20 years in the making, according to its filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson. DiCaprio stars as Bob, a paranoid ex-revolutionary living off-grid, who reunites with former accomplices as he's forced to confront an old nemesis after his daughter goes missing.  Director Anderson came up with the idea for the film, which also stars Teyana Taylor and Regina Hall, more than two decades ago, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon's 1990 novel Vineland. DiCaprio, who won an Oscar in 2016 for survival epic The Revenant, told the BBC the film reflects what he sees as the growing polarisation in society. \"It holds a mirror up to society and talks about the divisiveness in our culture and the fact that there's so much polarity.\"  The Wolf of Wall Street actor explained that while he doesn't feel like there's a central message to the film, \"there's an interesting undercurrent about extremism\". \"It's political without making it feel like medicine,\" he adds. The Usual Suspects actor del Toro plays martial arts instructor Sergio, who comes to Bob's help when he's under threat.  He explains that the film \"says something about its time\" but \"it's also entertaining, fun and has a lot of heart\".  Del Toro was most excited about having been able to work with DiCaprio, who he has \"admired and wanted to work with for many years\".  \"Leo and I are from the same class if Hollywood was a university - I've met him many times and then finally we got a chance to work together.  \"It's a dream come true and he's very funny in real life and in the movie.\" One Battle After Another is part political satire, part black comedy and part action blockbuster, and DiCaprio says overall the film \"finds the humanity in all the central characters\".  \"It's about the people in the film and the characters - I'm a flawed protagonist - you can relate to them and their struggles and that's not an easy thing to do.\"  The Titanic star previously told Entertainment Tonight his character is the opposite of Tom Cruise in Mission: Impossible as Bob \"does everything wrong and doesn't land or stick any of his stunts\".  The film has been warmly received by critics with most of them awarding it five stars.  The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey hailed it as a \"ferocious American masterpiece\" that is \"swaggering, funny and a timely action epic\".  In a five-star review, The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said the film's themes of \"dissent, discontent and the lonely heroism of not fitting in\" is made more interesting as \"these ideas are very unfashionable in the US right now\". The Telegraph's Robbie Collin also gave a five-star review, and praised the acting.   \"Penn is a knockout tragicomic villain: it's his best performance in years,\" he wrote. He added that DiCaprio \"astounds \u2013 frazzled and absurd yet also sweet and even noble, he evokes Jack Nicholson in his prime\".  The Times's Kevin Maher awarded the film four-stars, calling it a \"career high\" for Shutter Island actor DiCaprio, adding the film is \"a surefire Oscar frontrunner\". Maher said Anderson, operating with an alleged budget of $175m, was working on \"his most ambitious canvas\" and concluded the film has an \"easy best picture Oscar nomination in the bag\". DiCaprio said that Anderson has \"done a lot of films but in this one, he really went for it\". Anderson also directed 2017's Phantom Thread and 2007's There Will Be Blood, both of which won Oscars.  Praising the filmmaker, DiCaprio called him \"a visionary and seminal director\".  Organisers say each screening will be followed a discussion and a vegetarian or vegan meal. The Sea follows a boy from the occupied West Bank who wants to visit Tel Aviv to see the sea for the first time. The hit young-adult series will conclude with what author and showrunner Han says is \"another big milestone\" in Belly's journey.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4 podcast Radical with Amol Rajan for London Fashion Week, Enninful suggested the industry risked going back to how it was before years of more inclusive modelling. \"I think we're potentially going back to an industry that's just sort of, 'one type is the norm, being European is the norm, being super-thin is the norm',\" he said. A string of high street fashion adverts that have been banned because they featured models who looked \"unhealthily thin\" has led industry experts to warn of a return to the super skinny trend, BBC News recently reported. Enninful described fashion as an \"industry in flux at the moment\". He said he's therefore \"excited\" to be returning at what feels like \"the perfect time\" because \"there's a lot of work to be done\". The first quarterly print edition of his new venture - titled 72 after the year he was born - focuses on the beauty of women over 50. It features Hollywood movie star and \"real human being\" Julia Roberts, 57, on its cover. Enninful came to London as an aslyum seeker, and after being appointed fashion director of the British fashion magazine i-D at the age of 18, he went on to become the first black editor-in-chief of British Vogue, where he championed diversity in order to \"represent the world we live in today.\" Asked by Rajan if he thought a cultural \"anti-woke moment\" was now taking place, he agreed. \"I think it's definitely a cultural moment,\" he replied. \"Woke is a dirty word. \"We see what's happening in the world politically. So anything that's not deemed as normal or the norm is seen as wrong.\" The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) defines \"woke\" as meaning \"well-informed\" or \"up-to-date\" as well as being \"alert to racial or social discrimination and injustice\". It has been seen as a badge of honour by some on the left, but more often as an insult by those on the right. The fashionista continued: \"It's not woke to think that someone curvy is beautiful, it's not woke to think someone from another country is beautiful.\" He believes the fashion industry \"has to figure out where we stand and what we stand for\". In the same interview, Enninful spoke about his departure from Vogue and his relationship with Dame Anna Wintour, who is stepping back as editor-in-chief of American Vogue after 37 years. He laughed at widespread reports the two had fallen out and that he had been forced out. \"When I took the job, I gave myself five years and I did six,\" he explained, adding that she had asked him to give them a year's notice so they could find his replacement, who turned out to be Chioma Nnadi. \"So it was my decision to leave. But I just loved all these stories like, oh my God, Anna and I were fighting!\" He said she was \"actually very supportive\" because she could see he was leaving \"a secure place\" like Vogue to go it alone. \"Anna and I, we text each other all the time. You're going to see us together.\" Enninful also gave his views on the controversial recent Sydney Sweeney jeans advert. US fashion retailer American Eagle had the Euphoria and White Lotus actress resplendent in its denim alongside the words: \"Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.\" Some people took the gene pun to mean the ad was implying a racially superior ideal of beauty. Others, however, backed Sweeney and described the outrage as overblown. \"I thought people really read into it probably deeper than I would have,\" said Enninful, noting how Sweeney is currently \"having a great moment\" in her career. \"But then also on the other hand, I guess if you have a blonde woman sitting there talking about her jeans, it will trigger some people. \"So I feel like the population is quite divided really, isn't it?\" All episodes of Radical with Amol Rajan are available to listen to on BBC Sounds.

    "summary": "BBC Sport examines how and why Liverpool's thrilling late winners have come about.",
    "text": "Liverpool's run of thrilling late goals is breaking records When Marcos Llorente scored his second goal to equalise for Atletico Madrid against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday, his team-mates and their coaching staff flooded on to the pitch to celebrate. Fair enough, surely? After all, there were less than 10 minutes remaining and the Spaniards had survived a flurry of missed chances before drawing level in a game in which they were second best. But this was Arne Slot's Liverpool, who have made a habit of scoring late winners. By the time captain Virgil van Dijk planted home a powerful header to snatch a 3-2 victory, the stoppage-time winner felt as inevitable as it did thrilling for the home fans. Liverpool have scored late winners in all five of their competitive matches this season: 4-2 v Bournemouth (H, Premier League) - Federico Chiesa 88' and Mohamed Salah 90+4' 3-2 v Newcastle (A, Premier League) - Rio Ngumoha 90+10' 1-0 v Arsenal (H, Premier League) - Dominik Szoboszlai 83' 1-0 v Burnley (A, Premier League) - Mohamed Salah (pen) 90+3'  3-2 v Atletico Madrid (H, Champions League) - Virgil van Dijk 90+2' That means the average point at which Liverpool's match-winning moments are happening this season is after 91 minutes. In 2024-25, the average time they scored the winning goal in matches they won by a single goal was 70 minutes. The run of late winners is a marked difference from last season, when Liverpool only scored four stoppage-time goals in 48 matches across the Premier League and Champions League - with two in the same game at Brentford. They did score 13 times after the 80th minute during that Premier League season - but four teams managed more. None of Liverpool's rivals score late winners at nearly the same rate. Looking at the other Premier League teams competing in the Champions League this season, Arsenal have the next best rate for winning goals after the 80th minute, but you have to go back 64 games (and 16 months) to reach the five Liverpool have scored in their past five matches. And Liverpool's flurry of late winners is already the longest in Premier League history. Slot, who replaced Jurgen Klopp last summer, thinks self-belief and fitness have been key to Liverpool's run. \"There will be games where we are 2-0 up after six minutes, then we will score a third and won't need stoppage time to get a late winner,\" he said on Wednesday. \"There will also be games where we need one in the last minute and we won't get it. But our mentality is we will always push. It's also about how fit and how well prepared we are that we are able to push one more time.\" Slot is already among the managers with the highest percentage of late wins in Premier League history. Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson were widely regarded as the masters of the late winner. And it's no surprise to see Ferguson holds the record for most winning goals scored after the 81st minute, though his old foe Arsene Wenger is not far behind. But even Ferguson's United only managed a longest run of two consecutive Premier League matches with winners scored after the 80th minute - doing so four times. Slot has also increased Liverpool's lead at the top of the rankings for Premier League teams who have scored the most winners in the 90th minute or later.  The Reds have now scored 47, with Arsenal on 34 and United on 33. The Reds' late wins this season have come about in a variety of circumstances.  Against Bournemouth and Atletico they were comfortably on top and built a two-goal advantage, before throwing away cheap goals and ultimately rectifying the situation after piling on the pressure. At 10-man Newcastle they also threw away a two-goal lead - but their late winner came against the run of play. And against Arsenal and Burnley they struggled to create clear-cut opportunities against resolute defences, ultimately prevailing thanks to set-pieces. There is no blueprint by which Liverpool are earning these victories, then. But looking at the way the goals have come about perhaps gives some insight into why they're happening. Liverpool's squad has been significantly overhauled since Klopp set about revamping their midfield in the summer of 2023. Only nine members of the first-team squad that finished the 2022-23 season remain. The revitalised group is led by a small collection of senior players who won every trophy on offer under Klopp - Alisson, Van Dijk, Andy Robertson, and Salah. The last of those has generated the most goal involvements for this season's late winners - scoring twice and assisting once. In fact, despite the average age of Liverpool's squad being 26.2, more than half of the late-goal involvements have been from players aged 32.5 or above. The average age per involvement of those who have scored or assisted Liverpool's late goals is 28.9 - and would be significantly higher (30.4) were it not for 17-year-old Ngumoha. Whether it is Slot or those on the pitch, then, it is largely Liverpool's wisest heads who are making the difference in the key moments.

    "summary": "The world's most prestigious scientific body raised concerns about the \"language of violence\" at the march.",
    "text": "Elon Musk's controversial comments at the Unite the Kingdom rally in London have raised doubts over his fellowship of the Royal Society - the world's most prestigious scientific institution. Addressing the rally organised by right-wing activist Tommy Robinson, Musk criticised \"uncontrolled migration\" and said: \"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.\" In response, Sir Adrian Smith, president of the Society, wrote a letter to fellows in which he raised concerns about \"resorting to the language of violence\" and the threat it posed to the organisation's values.  He said the matter would be discussed at the society's next council meeting. Elon Musk was first elected a fellow of the UK's national academy of sciences in 2018, for his work in the space and electric vehicle industries. But his continued participation in the Royal Society has grown increasingly controversial.  Earlier this year, thousands of scientists signed a letter raising concerns about his involvement in funding cuts to US scientific research, as part of his previous role in Trump's Department of Government Efficiency.  The Society debated his fellowship in March but it was decided he would remain. Some fellows said any attempts to remove him could be seen as a curtailment of freedom of expression. Without refencing Musk directly, Sir Adrian Smith wrote to fellows: \"I am sure that many of you will share my concern at the events of the last week and the growing tendency to resort to the language of violence in pursuit of political programmes - including, unfortunately, an address to the recent London rally from a Fellow of the Royal Society.\" He went on to say that: \"Most of us have had the good fortune to have lived our lives in contexts where core values of tolerance, courtesy, respect for others, and freedom of speech have been widely acknowledged and respected and we have come to take them for granted.\"  \"It is no accident that human understanding and science have also flourished to an extraordinary extent in this period. Threats to these values are now real,\" he finished. Addressing the crowds on Saturday via video link, Musk said: \"I think there's something beautiful about being British and what I see happening here is a destruction of Britain, initially a slow erosion but rapidly increasing erosion of Britain with massive uncontrolled migration. \"This is a message to the reasonable centre, the people who ordinarily wouldn't get involved in politics, who just want to live their lives. \"They don't want that, they're quiet, they just go about their business. \"My message is to them: if this continues, that violence is going to come to you, you will have no choice. You're in a fundamental situation here. \"Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die, that's the truth, I think.\" Any decision to remove Mr Musk would be a significant moment in the organisation's history. It is 250 years since a member of the Royal Society was ejected: German scientist and writer Rudolf Erich Raspe, who was accused of theft and fraud. Mr Musk has been approached for comment by BBC News sent via his companies Tesla and Space X. The world's most prestigious science institution has been considering whether to remove Musk as a fellow.

    "text": "Israel has carried out a large wave of air strikes in southern Lebanon, saying it was targeting positions of the Iranian-backed armed group Hezbollah.  The attacks came after evacuation warnings were issued for several locations. There has been no immediate report of casualties. Israel has carried out air strikes on people and places it says are linked to Hezbollah almost every day despite a deal that ended the war with the group in November. The Lebanese prime minister called on the international community to urge Israel to stop what he described as intimidation and attacks, and to fulfil its ceasefire obligations. Footage posted online showed huge plumes of smoke in Mais al-Jabal, one of the locations hit.  An Israeli military spokesman said the targets were infrastructure belonging to Hezbollah and in response to the group's attempts to re-establish activities in the area. He provided no evidence. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said its forces had attacked and raided Hezbollah weapons warehouses, and their presence \"constituted a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon\". He earlier had warned residents to evacuate buildings in the villages of Mais al-Jabal, Kfar Tibnit and Debbin, and later in two more villages. Lebanon's prime minister Nawaf Salam said on X his country was committed to ceasing hostile actions, but asked: \"Where is Israel's commitment to these mechanisms?\" He called on the international community, especially the countries sponsoring the ceasefire, \"to exert maximum pressure on Israel to immediately stop its aggressions\", to immediately withdraw from Lebanese territory and release prisoners. The US and France-brokered ceasefire was agreed between the governments of Israel and Lebanon, not Hezbollah.  It states that Lebanon will \"prevent Hezbollah and all other armed groups in the territory of Lebanon from carrying out any operations against Israel\". Meanwhile, Israel will \"not carry out any offensive military operations against Lebanese targets, including civilian, military, or other state targets, in the territory of Lebanon\". The Lebanese government has tasked the army with establishing a state monopoly on arms, a decision which Hezbollah has said it will disregard. Compelling evidence to suggest Lebanese Shia leader Musa al-Sadr was killed in Libya is uncovered by BBC. The UN says the almost 50-year mission will come to an end in 2027, as 300 Irish peacekeepers still stationed in south Lebanon.

    "summary": "The Tobermory house was home to nursery teacher Miss Hoolie in the Cbeebies show.",
    "text": "The bright green cottage from children's television show Balamory has been put on the market on the Isle of Mull.  The Tobermory house became home to the Bafta-winning programme's main character - nursery teacher Miss Hoolie, played by Julie Wilson Nimmo.  Owner Matthew Spence, who has lived in the cottage for almost four decades, said he and his wife \"fell\" for Balamory after agreeing to allow their home to be part of the programme.  The house became part of children's television history and has seen \"busloads\" of preschool pilgrims wanting to visit the set in the colourful harbour town. The programme - which was produced from 2002 to 2005 - became famous for its catchy theme tune, which began: \"What's the story in Balamory, wouldn't you like to know?\" At its peak it attracted two million viewers a week in the UK and was watched by millions more around the world, becoming a hit with young audiences in Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada and South Africa. Over 152 episodes, problems in the island community were worked out by eight main characters - the teacher, police officer, inventor, school bus driver, painter, fitness instructor and the two shopkeepers - sometimes with the help of celebrity guests. As each of the main characters dressed in a colour matching their home, Miss Hollie was always in green outfits.  Filming for a new series began this year ahead of a 2026 reboot, with original stars Julie Wilson Nimmo (Miss Hoolie), Andrew Agnew (PC Plum), Kim Tserkezie (Penny Pocket) and Juliet Cadzow (Edie McCredie) included in the cast. Miss Hoolie's famous green house is actually Beul An Atna \u2013 Gaelic for \"Mouth of the Sea\", a former bed and breakfast on West Street.  Although the building has had coats of paint in a few colours over the years, it was returned to green ahead of the filming this summer. After 38 years, Mr Spence, who is now in his 80s, has put the traditional three-bedroom cottage on the market for offers over \u00a3225,000. \"I came to Mull from Glasgow when I was just 15,\" said Mr Spence, whose father was from Mull.  \"At the time I thought it was the end of the world.\" However, he said the island changed him and he eventually \"fell in love with the place\". When someone came to his door asking if he and his wife would like the house to feature in a children's TV show, they did not hesitate.  \"[She] said yes straight away\", he recalled. \"Anything to do with children - we had none ourselves \u2013 and we just fell for it.\" When children wanted to engage with their favourite programme, his wife replied to all the letters sent to the green house.  \"In summer, two busloads of children would park across the road every day,\" Mr Spence said. \"She loved it.  \"Even my wee dog loved it \u2013 the kids used to post sweets through the door. He turned from a Jack Russell into a wee barrel. \"Sometimes there'd be half a dozen kids in the house with their carers \u2013 it was a full house.\" Mr Spence said it was great to see the actors back filming the latest series.  He said: \"They came to the door and I had a big cuddle with PC Plum. \"I'll be sad to leave. Looking back, I get emotional. You never realise how much you collect until you start packing.\" Estate agent Andrew Fuller, from Bell Ingram, said it was a \"real pleasure to bring such a well-loved home to the market\". He said: \"As a resident of Mull, I know just how iconic the green house is \u2013 it's part of the island's story. \"While it's bittersweet to see it change hands, this sale marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter for a property that holds so many happy memories.\" More than 40 episodes from the fourth series of Balamory are on BBC iPlayer, more than two decades after they were first aired on terrestrial TV.  The Birmingham-based company Threewise Entertainment is bringing Bagpuss to cinemas in 2027. The estimated cost soared from \u00a350m in 2020 to \u00a396m due to inflationary cost increases. It will be the first new official Bagpuss production since the original beloved 1974 series. Colin Morrison's charity calendars have landed more than \u00a342,000 for good causes on the islands.

    "summary": "The Bank of England governor warns \"we're not out of the woods yet\" in terms of rising inflation.",
    "text": "UK interest rates have been held at 4% as the Bank of England governor warned \"we're not out of the woods yet\" in terms of rising inflation. Analysts had not expected interest rates, which influence borrowing costs and returns on savings, to be cut given that prices are rising at nearly twice the Bank's target rate. The Bank said it expected inflation to return to its key target of 2%, but remains cautious on when it will trim borrowing costs again. Alongside the interest rate decision, the Bank also announced it would reduce the amount of government debt it holds at a slower pace, coming just weeks after turmoil in the financial markets. The Bank has cut interest rates five times since August last year as the pace of inflation eased.  However, since April inflation has been heading higher again - fuelled in part by rising food costs. While it kept rates on hold this time, the Bank said that two of the nine members of its rate-setting Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) had voted to cut rates to 3.75%. The MPC will meet two more times this year to discuss rates, and the Bank said any further cuts would depend on whether it sees evidence that price pressures were easing. \"We're not out of the woods yet so any future cuts will need to be made gradually and carefully,\" said the Bank's governor, Andrew Bailey. He said: \"I continue to think there will be some further reductions but the timing and scale of those is more uncertain now.\" The Bank also announced it would reduce the rate at which it sells its stock of UK bonds. This is mainly government debt the Bank amassed during difficult periods, such as the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the Covid pandemic, as a way of stimulating the economy.  As Chancellor Rachel Reeves prepares to announce the Budget on 26 November, a higher cost of servicing Britain's vast pile of debt risks reducing the amount of headroom she has against her self-imposed tax and spending rules. At its peak, the Bank of England had accumulated \u00a3875bn worth of bonds. It has been reducing the amount of debt it owns by about \u00a3100bn a year through a process known as \"quantitative tightening\". But on Thursday it said that from October onwards, it would reduce that to \u00a370bn a year. Mr Bailey said the change would allow the Bank to carry on with its plans \"while continuing to minimise the impact on gilt market conditions\". Looking ahead to November, the Bank said business sentiment was \"downbeat\" with many firms pointing to \"the government's upcoming autumn Budget as a source of uncertainty\".  The Bank's regional offices speak to companies before every interest rate decision to gauge what business conditions are like. It said that while consumer goods inflation was modest in many areas, it remains \"elevated for food\". Fresh figures this week showed that while the overall pace of inflation stayed at 3.8% in the year to August, food and non-alcoholic drinks costs grew by 5.1%, led by beef, butter, milk and chocolate prices.  The cost of providing consumer facing services is also up, firms told the Bank, \"as businesses pass on higher labour and food costs where they can, and is likely to remain higher this year\".  Spending remains subdued across many sectors including hotel accommodation and tourism in the UK. The Bank said any demand tended \"to be centred around events such as Oasis concerts\". Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said: \"The fact interest rates are not coming down faster is a result of Labour's reckless decisions which have pushed up inflation.\" The UK government hopes the investment will create more than 7,600 \"high-quality jobs\". The warning from the clothing chain comes as it reported a 13.8% rise in pre-tax profits. UK Inflation has fallen from record highs but remains above the Bank of England's 2% target. Borrowing costs are not guaranteed to come down much more than they already have, even after this week's rate cut. Microsoft, Google and Nvidia have announced investments as part of a \u00a331bn UK-US \"Tech Prosperity Deal\".\n  Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Their lawyer says the French president and Mrs Macron will present the documentation in a defamation suit they have taken against the right-wing influencer Candace Owens after she promoted her belief that Brigitte Macron was born male. Ms Owens' lawyers have responded with a motion to dismiss the claim. Speaking to the BBC's Fame Under Fire podcast, the Macrons' lawyer in the case, Tom Clare, said Mrs Macron had found the claims \"incredibly upsetting\" and they were a \"distraction\" to the French president. \"I don't want to suggest that it somehow has thrown him off his game.

Mr Clare said there would be \"expert testimony that will come out that will be scientific in nature\" and while he would not reveal, at this stage, its exact nature, he said the couple were prepared to demonstrate fully \"both generically and specifically\" that the allegations are false. \"It is incredibly upsetting to think that you have to go and subject yourself, to put this type of proof forward,\" he said. \"It is a process that she will have to subject herself to in a very public way. But she's willing to do it. She is firmly resolved to do what it takes to set the record straight. \"If that unpleasantness and that discomfort that she has of opening herself up in that way is what it takes to set a record straight and stop this, she's 100% ready to meet that burden.\" When asked if the Macrons would be supplying pictures of Brigitte pregnant and raising her children, Mr Clare said they existed and would be presented in court where there are rules and standards. Ms Owens, a former commentator for conservative US outlet Daily Wire who has millions of followers on social media, has repeatedly promoted her view that Brigitte Macron is a man. In March 2024, she claimed she would stake her \"entire professional reputation\" on the allegation. The allegation originated in fringe online spaces years earlier, notably through a 2021 YouTube video by French bloggers Amandine Roy and Natacha Rey. The Macrons initially won a defamation case in France against Roy and Rey in 2024, but that ruling was overturned on appeal in 2025 on freedom of expression grounds, not on the basis of truth. The Macrons are appealing the decision. In July, the Macrons filed a lawsuit against Ms Owens in the US. It alleges she \"disregarded all credible evidence disproving her claim in favour of platforming known conspiracy theorists and proven defamers\". In American defamation cases against public figures, plaintiffs are required to prove \"actual malice\" - that the defendant knowingly spread false information or acted with reckless disregard for the truth. In August, Emmanuel Macron explained to French magazine, Paris Match, why they had chosen to pursue legal action. \"This is about defending my honour! Because this is nonsense. This is someone who knew full well that she had false information and did so with the aim of causing harm, in the service of an ideology and with established connections to far-right leaders.\" Ms Owens' lawyers have responded to the Macrons' lawsuit with a motion to dismiss, arguing that the case should not have been filed in Delaware, as she says it does not relate to her businesses, which are incorporated in the state. They claim forcing her to defend the case in Delaware would cause \"substantial financial and operational hardship\". The BBC has approached Candace Owens' legal team for a comment. She has previously said she believes what she is saying is true and there is nothing more American than free speech and the ability to criticise. Trump signs a proclamation establishing a task force to take on crime in the Democrat-led city despite opposition from its mayor. A grassroots movement is encouraging people to protest against the political class and proposed budget cuts. It comes after a vote of confidence ousted Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou after nine months in power. Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou has handed in his resignation, leaving France without a prime minister on the eve of nationwide protests. The Russian leader's refusal comes after 26 countries pledged to deploy troops to Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

    "summary": "Using the cafe to treat patients \"will not be allowed to happen again\", the trust's boss says.",
    "text": "A hospital boss has apologised after a Kent emergency department resorted to using its cafe as a makeshift ward. A&E staff at William Harvey Hospital in Ashford decided to screen off the building's cafe on Tuesday to create space for treating patients. East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust said the move was due to \"significant demand\". Trust chief executive Tracey Fletcher said: \"We know this is unacceptable and we are very sorry to patients who have been cared for in this way.\" A \"small number\" of patients were looked after in the cafe until emergency patients could be diverted to other hospitals in Kent, the trust said. Labour MP for Ashford Sojan Joseph said it was \"not acceptable\" to use corridors to care for patients but said staff worked  \"incredibly hard under very difficult circumstances caused by a decade and a half of cuts\". However, he said senior management across East Kent Hospitals \"must do more to step up and improve standards across all levels of care\". Ken Rogers, chairman of Concern for Health in East Kent, said: \"This type of patient experience will never end unless there is serious investment in east Kent instead of sticking plaster-type cures.\" Acute care in east Kent will \"eventually collapse\" without intervention, he added. He said he had written to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, inviting him to visit the area's hospitals and calling for further investment. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the incident was \"unacceptable\" and the government expected the hospital to \"take urgent action to address this\". They said the government was \"working at pace\" to improve emergency care for patients. Ms Fletcher said it was \"sometimes necessary\" to treat patients in corridors despite staff's efforts, but that use of the cafe, first reported by Kent Online, \"will not be allowed to happen again\". The trust was ranked 101 out of 134 in a league table of trusts' performance that NHS England published earlier this month. Follow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "summary": "A specialist took the gold artefact from a Cairo museum and sold it through a jeweller, officials say.",
    "text": "A 3,000-year-old gold bracelet that disappeared from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo was stolen and melted down, Egypt's interior ministry says. A restoration specialist took the artefact - which dates back to the reign of King Amenemope, a pharaoh who ruled Egypt around 1,000BC \u2013 from a safe at the museum nine days ago, according to the ministry. The woman contacted a silver jeweller she knew, who sold the bracelet to a gold jeweller for $3,735 (\u00a32,750), it said. He then sold it for $4,025 to a gold foundry worker, who had melted it down with other jewellery, it added. The ministry said the four individuals confessed to their crimes after being arrested and that the money was seized. The ministry added that legal action would be taken against them. On Tuesday, Egypt's tourism and antiquities ministry announced that it had taken immediate measures after the bracelet disappeared from the Egyptian Museum's restoration laboratory, and that the case had been referred to police. An image of the gold band adorned with spherical lapis lazuli beads had been circulated to all Egyptian airports, seaports and land border crossings as a precaution to prevent it being smuggled out of the country, it said. Local media reported that the disappearance was detected in recent days as museum staff were preparing to ship dozens of artefacts to Rome for an exhibition. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo is the oldest archaeological museum in the Middle East. It houses more than 170,000 artefacts, including Amenemope's gilded wooden funerary mask. The bracelet's theft came weeks before the opening of the Grand Egyptian Museum in nearby Giza, where the famous treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb have been transferred. Manchester City will be without forward Omar Marmoush for Sunday's Manchester derby after the Egyptian suffers a knee injury on international duty.  Ethiopia is set to inaugurate a mega dam that has stoked tensions with Egypt.

    "summary": "As Jose Mourinho returns to Benfica after 25 years, is it a risk for both parties with elections looming?",
    "text": "Jose Mourinho began his managerial career at Benfica 25 years ago, before a spell at Uniao de Leiria and then Porto It's a long time since Jose Mourinho took to the dugout as manager of Benfica. A quarter of a century, in fact. In that time he clambered to the very top of the footballing tree and broke a few branches on his way back to the red side of Lisbon. A glittering 25 years have seen the self-proclaimed 'Special One' collect two Champions Leagues, a Uefa Cup, Europa League, Conference League, eight league titles and numerous other silverware in a career that has spanned 10 clubs. He is still revered in Portugal among the generation of fans who remember him leading Porto to European glory, winning the treble with Inter and managing some of the world's biggest sides in Chelsea, Real Madrid and Manchester United. Despite his last league title coming a decade ago, there is huge hype around the 62-year-old's return.  Outside the new Estadio da Luz, yet to be built when Mourinho last coached Benfica, there was a thrum of media activity and excitement as news broke of the veteran boss' return. \"We are missing those kinds of iconic coaches here in Portugal,\" explains CNN journalist Joao Pedro Oca, speaking between live hourly broadcasts outside the stadium. \"His legacy is awesome here, mainly because of what he did in Porto. \"[But] Mourinho was linked to Benfica for a lot of years. This is something everyone expected, the return of Mourinho to Portugal and to Benfica and [eventually] to the national team. It was a question of time.\" But there is also a feeling this appointment is a risk - not only for Benfica but Mourinho, too, with Benfica's presidential elections beginning on 25 October. \"He is a cherished figure in Portugal, one that almost transcends club rivalries,\" explains Expresso journalist Diogo Pombo. \"But peak Mourinho is long gone and people are aware of his conflictual style from the last few years. \"But he has a story in Benfica and that works in his favour - when he left the club, he was loved by the fans despite only managing the team for 11 games and what he left was a sensation of injustice, of a chaotic club wasting the opportunity to grow with such an ambitious coach.\" Mourinho appointed Benfica manager Who will Jose Mourinho's Benfica face in Champions League? Jose Mourinho spent 11 games in charge of Benfica in 2000 Manuel Vilarinho, Benfica president at the time, later said he rued the decision not to renew Mourinho's contract when the fiery young boss - in his first managerial role - threatened to quit because he did not feel he had his backing. Vilarinho had just replaced Joao Vale e Azevedo, the president who appointed Mourinho a month earlier, four weeks into the season and almost exactly 25 years ago to the day. Mourinho - believing Vilarinho wanted a different coach - stuck to his word by stepping down in December 2000, having won six of his 11 games in charge. \"He made such a big impact,\" says Benfica FM podcast host Filipe Ingles. \"Benfica at the time was terrible. It was the worst season in all of Benfica history. \"We started playing so much better with Mourinho and it was already the Mourinho that we know from Porto and from Chelsea. At press conferences, he was already that big figure.\" Benfica were in the middle of an 11-year run without a Portuguese title. They only ended it once Mourinho left Porto for Chelsea in 2004, having won the Champions League. \"Of course, we always think what could have been if Mourinho had stayed at Benfica,\" adds Ingles. \"Maybe Mourinho can change that now - 25 years later.\" This time, the shoe is on the other foot. Rui Costa, part of the Eagles side who won the league in 1994 and a star for the national team, is the president banking on Mourinho's arrival securing him another term. \"The fans might view his appointment as a kind of union finally fulfilled,\" adds Pombo. \"But the eve of another election is affecting the way his return is received.\" This video can not be played Mourinho will love being back at Benfica Costa said when he sacked Bruno Lage following a 3-2 defeat by Qarabag in the Champions League on Tuesday that a \"Benfica coach's profile must be that of a winner\". Mourinho's last trophy, however, came three years ago, winning the Conference League with Roma. Before that, it was the Europa League with Manchester United in 2017, and his last league title came at Chelsea in 2015. He did end his tenure at Fenerbahce with a 71.1% win ratio in the league - only bettered by his time at Porto (75.9%) and Real Madrid (76.3%). But, having finished second behind Galatasaray last term, Mourinho was sacked when Fenerbahce were knocked out of this season's Champions League play-offs by, of all clubs, Benfica. \"Benfica needs a new coach, needs a different approach, needs a strong figure on the bench,\" adds Oca. \"The majority of Benfica fans think Mourinho is a good choice. \"The problem is the timing. It is a very tricky situation. We don't know about the future. It is a very risky move for Rui Costa but also for Mourinho.\" Costa has insisted appointing Mourinho is a sporting decision, rather than a high-profile move to help him get re-elected. \"I've never put my interests ahead of Benfica's, and I'm not going to do so now,\" he said.  According to a poll on Portuguese TV on Wednesday, the current president sits second out of six candidates before October's elections - though some suggest it is too close to call between the top three names. \"The other candidates are saying that this is not OK,\" explains Ingles. \"If there is a new president, which is very likely, it will be a hard situation for both - Mourinho has a new president and the new president is stuck with an expensive manager. \"There are a lot of doubts, this feeling that Rui Costa is doing this as a Hail Mary for his re-election, because in four years he has only one championship and it's not good that you sack your manager at the beginning of the season.\" Beyond the political argument around Mourinho's arrival, there is of course huge intrigue and expectation.  \"If you said to me or to any Benfica fan that Mourinho would be coming five or 10 years ago, we would be ecstatic, we would be so thrilled,\" says Ingles. \"Without a doubt, he's the best Portuguese manager of all time and he was one of the best managers in the world, but I'm talking about the past, so there will be a few doubts if he's still the great Mourinho that he once was. \"Journalists are ecstatic in Portugal that he is coming back. Of course, there will be a lot of attention and a lot of curiosity to see if he can still make a statement in Portuguese football, which I think he can. \"Benfica has very good players and if Mourinho doesn't win the title, it will be considered a failure.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast  Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Champions League: Napoli down to 10 at Man City, Newcastle host Barcelona Women's Champions League: Hat-trick for Terland as Man Utd on course to qualify Mourinho back at Benfica 25 years on - revered but a risk?

    "summary": "BBC Sport examines how and why Liverpool's thrilling late winners have come about.",
    "text": "Liverpool's run of thrilling late goals is breaking records When Marcos Llorente scored his second goal to equalise for Atletico Madrid against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday, his team-mates and their coaching staff flooded on to the pitch to celebrate. Fair enough, surely? After all, there were less than 10 minutes remaining and the Spaniards had survived a flurry of missed chances before drawing level in a game in which they were second best. But this was Arne Slot's Liverpool, who have made a habit of scoring late winners. By the time captain Virgil van Dijk planted home a powerful header to snatch a 3-2 victory, the stoppage-time winner felt as inevitable as it did thrilling for the home fans. Liverpool have scored late winners in all five of their competitive matches this season: 4-2 v Bournemouth (H, Premier League) - Federico Chiesa 88' and Mohamed Salah 90+4' 3-2 v Newcastle (A, Premier League) - Rio Ngumoha 90+10' 1-0 v Arsenal (H, Premier League) - Dominik Szoboszlai 83' 1-0 v Burnley (A, Premier League) - Mohamed Salah (pen) 90+3'  3-2 v Atletico Madrid (H, Champions League) - Virgil van Dijk 90+2' That means the average point at which Liverpool's match-winning moments are happening this season is after 91 minutes. In 2024-25, the average time they scored the winning goal in matches they won by a single goal was 70 minutes. The run of late winners is a marked difference from last season, when Liverpool only scored four stoppage-time goals in 48 matches across the Premier League and Champions League - with two in the same game at Brentford. They did score 13 times after the 80th minute during that Premier League season - but four teams managed more. None of Liverpool's rivals score late winners at nearly the same rate. Looking at the other Premier League teams competing in the Champions League this season, Arsenal have the next best rate for winning goals after the 80th minute, but you have to go back 64 games (and 16 months) to reach the five Liverpool have scored in their past five matches. And Liverpool's flurry of late winners is already the longest in Premier League history. Slot, who replaced Jurgen Klopp last summer, thinks self-belief and fitness have been key to Liverpool's run. \"There will be games where we are 2-0 up after six minutes, then we will score a third and won't need stoppage time to get a late winner,\" he said on Wednesday. \"There will also be games where we need one in the last minute and we won't get it. But our mentality is we will always push. It's also about how fit and how well prepared we are that we are able to push one more time.\" Slot is already among the managers with the highest percentage of late wins in Premier League history. Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson were widely regarded as the masters of the late winner. And it's no surprise to see Ferguson holds the record for most winning goals scored after the 81st minute, though his old foe Arsene Wenger is not far behind. But even Ferguson's United only managed a longest run of two consecutive Premier League matches with winners scored after the 80th minute - doing so four times. Slot has also increased Liverpool's lead at the top of the rankings for Premier League teams who have scored the most winners in the 90th minute or later.  The Reds have now scored 47, with Arsenal on 34 and United on 33. The Reds' late wins this season have come about in a variety of circumstances.  Against Bournemouth and Atletico they were comfortably on top and built a two-goal advantage, before throwing away cheap goals and ultimately rectifying the situation after piling on the pressure. At 10-man Newcastle they also threw away a two-goal lead - but their late winner came against the run of play. And against Arsenal and Burnley they struggled to create clear-cut opportunities against resolute defences, ultimately prevailing thanks to set-pieces. There is no blueprint by which Liverpool are earning these victories, then. But looking at the way the goals have come about perhaps gives some insight into why they're happening. Liverpool's squad has been significantly overhauled since Klopp set about revamping their midfield in the summer of 2023. Only nine members of the first-team squad that finished the 2022-23 season remain. The revitalised group is led by a small collection of senior players who won every trophy on offer under Klopp - Alisson, Van Dijk, Andy Robertson, and Salah. The last of those has generated the most goal involvements for this season's late winners - scoring twice and assisting once. In fact, despite the average age of Liverpool's squad being 26.2, more than half of the late-goal involvements have been from players aged 32.5 or above. The average age per involvement of those who have scored or assisted Liverpool's late goals is 28.9 - and would be significantly higher (30.4) were it not for 17-year-old Ngumoha. Whether it is Slot or those on the pitch, then, it is largely Liverpool's wisest heads who are making the difference in the key moments.

    "text": "This video can not be played Hodgkinson and Hunter Bell ease into 800m semi-finals Great Britain's Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson began her pursuit of a first world title by cruising through to the semi-finals of the women's 800m in Tokyo. Hodgkinson is the gold-medal favourite after running a world-leading time on her return to action in August, despite enduring a 376-day wait to make her competitive return following last summer's Games. Two hamstring tears later, she secured back-to-back wins in her only two pre-championship races in August. Returning to the stadium where she won Olympic silver as a teenager four years ago, the 23-year-old controlled her heat to reach Friday's semi-finals. There, she will be joined by training partner Georgia Hunter Bell as the pair target a spectacular British one-two in the event. \"I don't like the rounds, they feel awful, they are awful. I just really wanted to enjoy being back in the stadium. It's so nice to be here,\" Hodgkinson told BBC Sport. \"It wasn't pretty or dominant, but it's nice to be safely through. It's been a long week waiting around. Whoever put the 800m last, thank you. \"I've just been looking forward to getting out here, at one point I didn't even know if I'd be here. It definitely means a lot, round by round I'm hoping it goes my way. \"It would mean even more than last year [to win]. I'm just trying to embrace it all.\" Hodgkinson won her heat in a comfortable one minute 59.79 seconds - a time more than five seconds slower than her British record. Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Hunter Bell, who chose to switch focus to the shorter of the middle-distance events in pursuit of another global podium, also began with victory, clocking 1:58.82. Hunter Bell told BBC Sport: \"We have been out in Japan for a long time, so it felt like Christmas morning getting out on track.  \"Doing the 800m is the right decision. I feel like I have really got something to show - I have a high ranking and with my team-mate this was the year to do it.\" Gold medal threats remain in the shape of Kenya's reigning champion Mary Moraa, Ethiopia's Olympic silver medallist Tsige Duguma and in-form Swiss athlete Audrey Werro. However, British team-mate Jemma Reekie missed out after placing fifth in her heat.

McLaughlin-Levrone, a two-time Olympic and world 400m hurdles champion, hinted that she could threaten German Marita Koch's controversial 1985 record of 47.60 seconds by breaking Sanya Richards-Ross' United States record in the semi-finals.  In wet conditions at Japan's National Stadium, the 26-year-old 400m hurdles record holder clocked the second-fastest 400m flat time in history with 47.78.  World indoor champion Anning, 24, replicated her top-five placing at the Paris 2024 Olympics, running a season's best 49.36. This video can not be played Hughes and Lyles reach 200m final Britain's Zharnel Hughes, Dina Asher-Smith and Amy Hunt each reached the finals of their respective 200m events. Hughes, unable to make the 100m final after winning bronze in 2023, secured his place in the medal race as he followed three-time defending champion Noah Lyles across the line in 19.95 seconds. Lyles produced a statement performance in his favoured event. Having already established a significant advantage over his semi-final competition, the American did not ease up and crossed the line in a world-leading time of 19.51. Hunt ran a personal best 22.08 to follow two-time defending champion Shericka Jackson into the women's 200m final from their heat. Dina Asher-Smith qualified in second in her heat, behind American 100m champion Melissa Jefferson-Wooden. But Daryll Neita was unable to make it a British trio in to the final as she finished fourth.

Pattison could only finish fifth in a race featuring Olympic medallists Marco Arop and Djamel Sedjati. Hannah Nuttall reached Saturday's women's 5,000m final by finishing seventh in her heat in 14:48.09, but Melissa Courtney-Bryant and Innes FitzGerald missed out.

    "text": "This video can not be played Boulter win puts GB into BJK Cup semi-finals Katie Boulter says she is hopeful it is Great Britain's time to win a first Billie Jean King Cup after an impressive 2-0 win over Japan secured their place in the semi-finals. Boulter and Sonay Kartal triumphed in their singles matches on Thursday to set up a last-four meeting with the United States. Should Britain beat the 18-time champions, they would reach a first final in 44 years and a fifth overall. No nation has reached the BJK Cup title match more times than Britain's four without winning it. Boulter and Jodie Burrage produced a superb doubles performance to beat the Netherlands 2-1 in April and qualify for the eight-team Finals, and they appear to be continuing their momentum in Shenzhen. \"This team qualified earlier in the year and we showed a lot of heart,\" Boulter said. \"The team deserves to be here and hopefully we can go to the final. Hopefully this is our time now.\" Boulter is the nation's leading singles player in China in the absence of Emma Raducanu, who withdrew at the start of September to focus on playing on the WTA Tour instead. But despite her absence Britain looked strong against Japan, with Kartal winning 6-3 7-6 (7-4) against Ena Shibahara before Boulter ruthlessly beat Moyuka Uchijima 6-2 6-1. \"Sonay put in a clinical performance so she makes it easy to follow,\" added Boulter. Boulter has endured a difficult season in singles and her opening-round loss at the US Open saw her drop of the top 50. But she has always been impressive when representing her country, winning 17 of 23 matches played for Britain. Boulter's serving was strong throughout against Uchijima, with the Briton winning 70% of first-serve points. After getting the first break in the fifth game of the opening set, Boulter reeled off the next three games on her way to taking the first set. Boulter maintained that momentum with a break at the start of the second set, with her aggressive play always having Uchijima on the defence.  The pressure proved too much as Boulter secured two further breaks on the way to a dominant win. \"I stayed out there as much as possible and tried to focus on myself,\" Boulter said.  \"I am super happy to be through and it is nice to have some British fans here.\" GB have 'real shot' at BJK Cup win without Raducanu Svitolina secures 'historical moment' for Ukraine in BJK Cup Defending champions Italy battle into BJK Cup semis This video can not be played GB's Kartal dominates rallies BJK Cup match win World number 82 Kartal, who reached the fourth round at Wimbledon for the first time this summer, has won all three of her BJK Cup ties since making her debut earlier this year. Kartal was confident and in control from the outset against Shibahara, claiming back-to-back breaks on her way to racing into a 4-0 lead. Shibahara looked nervous early on but shifted the momentum her way when she won eight points in a row to claw back to 4-3. But with a break still behind her, Kartal halted Shibahara's run with a hold to love that unsettled her opponent once more. Mistakes crept in on the Japanese's service game, allowing Kartal to take advantage and clinch the opening set. The second set was a far closer affair, and Kartal had to dig deep to fend off a break-point chance at 4-4. Although she could not break the obstinate Shibahara's serve, Kartal dominated the tie-break, securing victory on her second match point. \"Their [Japan's] whole team is super tough so I knew it was not going to be easy in the slightest,\" Kartal said. \"I tried to play my game when things got tough and stay aggressive. I backed myself all the way.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Champions League: Napoli down to 10 at Man City, Newcastle host Barcelona Women's Champions League: Hat-trick for Terland as Man Utd on course to qualify Mourinho back at Benfica 25 years on - revered but a risk?

The Sensex was down 113.57 points or 0.4 percent at 28220.98, and the Nifty slipped 25.20 points or 0.3 percent at 8743.95.

HUL, Tata Motors, Asian Paints, L&T and NTPC were gainers in the Sensex while ONGC, Axis Bank, Bajaj Auto, M&M and Hero MotoCorp were losers. 2:55 pm RBI rate cut: A day after the monetary policy committee (MPC) debuted with a surprise 0.25 percent cut in rates, analysts today said the Reserve Bank will continue with the accommodative stance but the next action can come only in the February review. In a note, domestic rating agency Icra said it expects the rate easing cycle to continue. \"With the indication that real interest rates (the differential between the key lending rate and inflation) may need to be lower than 1.50 percent given prevailing global scenario of negative rates, further easing by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) can't be ruled out,\" its senior vice president Karthik Srinivasan said, adding that he is uncertain over the timing.2:45 pm Metals buzzing2:30 pm Deal: Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure today signed an agreement to sell its power transmission assets to Adani Group for over Rs 2,000 crore. Reliance Infra owns two electricity transmission lines spanning Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka and has a 74 percent stake in another in Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. \"Reliance Infrastructure Ltd (RInfra) today announced the signing of a binding term sheet with Adani Transmission Ltd (ATL) for 100 percent stake sale of its transmission assets,\" the company said in a statement here. While the two companies did not give valuation of the deal, banking sources said the sale consideration was in excess of Rs 2,000 crore.

About 1655 shares have advanced, 1077 shares declined, and 122 shares are unchanged. Asian Paints, SBI, Tata Motors, HUL and Maruti Suzuki are top gainers while ONGC, Axis Bank, M&M, Bajaj Auto and Hero MotoCorp are major losers in the Sensex. SBI, Force Motors, Vakrangee and Hindustan Zinc are most active stocks in the BSE. Tirthankar Patnaik, India Strategist at Mizuho Bank says there is a definite scope for further easing even though the Reserve Bank's monetary policy did not specifically mention it in its statement on Tuesday, said RBI lowering the real rate to 125 basis points leaves significant scope for further easing, he said. \"Going forward in the monetary policy report, we notice that they are looking at a 4.5 percent figure for March 2018 and now on 4.5 percent you put a 125 bps real rate gives you 5.25 percent on the policy which essentially means that even from current levels you still have another 50 bps to go over the next year in terms of incremental easing,\" Patnaik added.\n                               Discover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Invest Now Gaurav Choudhurymoneycontrol.com The government has readied plans for a major change in India\u2019s tax administration structure, including overhauling the Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC) to ensure a glitch-free roll-out of a nation-wide goods and services tax (GST). The plan, reviewed by Moneycontrol, includes setting up of empowered GST commissionerates within the CBEC that will be tasked with administering the new tax system. GST, billed as India\u2019s most ambitious reforms move, will stitch together a common national market, dismantle fiscal barriers among states and consolidate a patchwork of local and central duties into a single levy. The government expects to roll out GST from April 1, 2017. For the purposes of administration, the country will be divided into 24 zones and 107 GST commissionerates. Each commissionerate will have oversight rights over 15,000-20,000 assessees with combined revenues of about Rs 5000 crore. Every state, except those with very small assessee-base, will have at least one commissionerate, which will be broken down into five divisions and 50 ranges for each. Besides, there will be one audit and one appeal commissioner for every GST commissionerate. With 3.34 lakh assesses, Mahrashtra will have 20 GST commissionerates\u2014the highest among all states. A Directorate General of Dispute Resolution (DGDR) will also be set up, to deal with possible Centre-state and inter-state rows that may arise after the new tax system kicks in. The DGDR will maintain data bank of judicial decisions, analyse dispute issues for identifying patterns and examine orders to assess fitness for appeals among others. Separate adjudication verticals will be set up in seven major cities-- in Delhi, Gandhinagar, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata--reporting directly to DGDR\u2014Delhi, Gandhinagar, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. A new sleuthing unit\u2014Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGSTI)\u2014will be set up tasked with keeping a close eye on compliance and detecting and collating information on tax. There will be at least one unit of DGSTI, which will replace the existing Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence (DGCEI). The existing Customs and Service Appellate Tribunal (CESTAT), however, a judicial body, will continue to run concurrently to deal with legacy cases, some which go back more than a decade.

He said one child policy could have been reason of sharp decline in child stunting and malnutrition, which is now at 10 percent. \"The one child policy could have been part of it, but anyway the point is, that if you look at educational outcomes and things like child stunting, India is at 38.7 percent child stunting, they are literally walking into the future with 40 percent of their workforce probably being unable to compete in the global digital economy, whereas China over the years has brought it down very, very low,\" Kim said. \"In India, it is probably partly because of sanitation that children are often in a just constant diarrheal stage, because of open defecation. There is a lot of different pieces of it. But I have been saying to the leaders of these countries that have these high stunting rates, there is like an emergency for you, you have got to tackle it,\" Kim said.\n                               Discover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Invest Now Moneycontrol BureauThe 2.46 crore equity shares' IPO of Endurance Technologies, the auto component manufacturer, has opened for subscription with a price band of Rs 467-472 per share on Wednesday.The Aurangabad-based company aims to mop up nearly Rs 1,162 crore (at higher end of price band) by diluting 17.5 percent stake through the issue that will close on October 7. It already raised Rs 348.52 crore through anchor investors' portion on Tuesday, the day before issue opening.It is an offer for sale of up to 1.93 crore equity shares by Actis Components and System Investments and up to 53.17 lakh shares by Anurang Jain, founder and managing director of the company. Hence, the company will not receive any proceeds from the offer.Considering Endurance's strong business model, financial position (return on equity & return on capital employed over 20 percent during FY13-16), track record of organic and inorganic growth, customer relationships with big clients in India as well as Europe, R&D capabilities and the largest two-wheeler & three-wheeler auto component supplier in India, analysts from top brokerage houses gave thumbs up to the issue.While recommending to subscribe, Angel Broking says it believes the issue is fairly priced at the current valuation considering its growth initiatives, scalability in operations, focus on profitability and strong return on equity (RoE) profile.At the higher end of the price band, company is asking for a valuation 22.9x of its FY16 EPS of Rs 20.6. This valuation looks at par with its peers, it feels.KR Choksey has maintained a positive view on the company with long term upward bias and expects the company to deliver healthy profitable growth going forward. It advised investors to subscribe the IPO and remain invested in Endurance's long term story.Asit C Mehta, which also recommended subscribing the issue for medium to long-term time horizon, believes it is available at discount to its peer such as Motherson Sumi (32.81x FY16 EPS), Bharat Forge (32.98x FY16 EPS), and at par with Gabriel India (22xof FY16 EPS).Endurance commands greater brand image in its product portfolio compared with its peers. It has a stable and long-term relationship with leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), which command greater market share in the Indian two and three wheeler segments. Focus on aftermarket sales service, which is high margin business, improving demand of scooter and moped among female and student customer, decreasing ownership cost places the company in a sweet spot to tap growth opportunities, Asit C Mehta says.Incorporated in 1999, the company is prominently 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler component supplier in India and 4-wheeler auto component supplier in Europe. It has 25 manufacturing facilities of which 18 are in India and 7 are in Europe (5 plants in Italy and 2 in Germany). Its India business has been an organic growth story while European business is fully acquired. It derives 70 percent revenue from India and 30 percent from Europe.The company is expected to commission an additional machining plant in Germany in current financial year. It is currently in the initial stages of planning an automotive proving ground (test track) in Aurangabad, Maharashtra, which it is expected to be operational by the end of 2018.It is also planning on setting up a new plant at Halol (Gujarat), which it is expected to complete in FY18 for the supply of suspension parts to Hero.Its largest customer in India is Bajaj Auto that contributed 40 percent to net revenue, followed by Royal Enfield, Honda Motorcycle and Yamaha. In addition to that, it also supplies products to Hero Motocorp, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata and Suzuki. In Europe, its largest customer is FCA Italy SpA and it is also a supplier to Daimler.Currently it operates in five segments namely die-casting (that contributed 62.8 percent to revenue in FY16), suspension (23.3 percent), transmission (5.5 percent), brake systems (4.6 percent) and aftermarket (3.8 percent). The company has 4 patents, one design registered for an aluminium wheel casting and has applied for 39 patents and 3 design registrations for a wide range of products.Endurance is the largest aluminium die-casting company in India and has strong market share in its other products. The die-casting market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8-10 percent between FY16-FY19 whereas market for suspension, transmission and brake systems is expected to grow at a CAGR of 14.3 percent during the same period, Angel Broking says.The brokerage house believes that there is ample scope of growth from here considering recovery of Indian automobile industry has been better than expected.JHP Securities expects 2-wheeler industry to grow at 13.6 percent CAGR between FY16-18 which is expected to aid growth for Endurance. Two-wheeler business contributed 55 percent to consolidated revenue in FY16.The auto ancillary company has strong record of financials with revenue and net profit growing at a CAGR of over 8 percent & 12 percent during FY12-16 and 11.5 percent & 20 percent during FY14-16, respectively. In FY16, profit, revenue and EBITDA grew by 16 percent to Rs 292 crore, 6.5 percent to Rs 5,241 crore and 11 percent to Rs 711 crore compared with FY15, respectively.It reduced its debt to equity ratio from 0.60 percent in FY15 to 0.42 percent in FY16 due to focus on high margin replacement market and European market where the cash flow generation is better.Endurance has strong business in Europe, with net revenue from operations growing from Rs 1,098.68 crore in FY14 to Rs 1,566.65 crore in FY16, a CAGR of 19.4 percent. It entered into Europe with the acquisition of Endurance Amann (German subsidiary) in FY07 and Fondalmec (Italian subsidiary) in FY08.Aditya Birla Money Research, ICICIdirect, Nirmal Bang, Ajcon Global, Centrum Wealth Research, JHP Securities, SPA Securities, Hem Securities, NVS Wealth Managers and GEPL Capital also advised subscribing the issue but there are some risks to the issue.Religare says Endurance's business is highly dependent on Bajaj Auto in India and FCA Italy SpA in Europe (which contributed over 40 percent and 15 percent to revenue in FY16, respectively). The loss of such customers or a significant reduction in purchases by such customers could adversely affect the business.The company is heavily dependent on the performance of the automotive sector in India (particularly two-wheelers industry) and Europe (for four-wheeler market), it says.GEPL Capital says the pricing pressure from customers may adversely affect gross margin, profitability and ability to increase prices, which in turn may materially adversely affect business, results of operations and financial condition.According to Centrum Wealth Research, increase in price of aluminium can have significant impact on company's profitability while ICICIdirect says unfavourable input price and currency movement can also have impact on its prospects.The book running lead managers to the issue are Axis Capital and Citigroup Global Markets India. Equity shares are proposed to be listed on the BSE and NSE.\n                               Discover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Invest Now Amidst rising tension, BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ban import of cement from Pakistan in the interest of domestic industry and national security. \"I request you to ban import of cement into the country not only in the interest of growth and sustenance of domestic cement industry but also in keeping with the imperatives of national security. Ban of import from Pakistan will be in the interest of the country's security in the present juncture,\" Swamy said in a letter to Modi. He said import of cement without levy of customs duty was introduced in 2007 to augment supply in view of high demand. He said the situation has since changed and the domestic industry has added a lot of capacity which is not being utilised, with around 116 million tonnes cement capacity lying idle due to stagnating demand in the country. He also referred to reports of recovery of drugs like heroin and fake Indian currency notes concealed in cement bags imported from Pakistan. \"Allowing imports of cement from Pakistan, therefore, carried with it the additional risk in that it provides an effective cover for smuggling of contraband goods and harmful weapons and ammunition concealed in cement bags which comes in rakes and trucks, in the hands of disruptionist elements,\" he said. The BJP leader said the industry today has a capacity utilisation of less than 70 percent with units in South India posting even lesser capacity utilsation. He further said that capital investment of more than Rs 90,000 crore required for creation of this capacity is lying stranded. \"India has become a dumping ground for imported cement, particularly from Pakistan, China and Bangladesh. It is ironical that while on every front Pakistan continues to trouble us, India continues to allow duty-free import of cement from Pakistan at the cost of Indian cement industry,\" he said. Swamy said importing cement with higher margins from Pakistan also goes against the 'Made in India concept'... This also strikes at the very root of your vision of the concept of 'Making in India',\" he said. The BJP leader said there is reverse charge duty structure as material required for cement manufacture attracts import duty while the finished product is not.\n                               Discover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Invest Now Priyanka Sahaymoneycontrol.com E-commerce firm Flipkart recorded sales worth around USD 200 million on Monday, its highest-ever single-day sale in the\u00a0company's history,\u00a0a spokesperson for\u00a0the company has told moneycontrol.com.The sales are likely\u00a0the results of a massive advertising campaign run by the company ahead of the upcoming festive season in India. As per market estimates, e-tailers such as Flipkart are expected to spend around Rs 400-Rs 500 crore in advertising during October, more than three times the usual money spent in steady state, according to research and advisory firm RedSeer Consulting.This is the third Big Billion Days sale being run by Flipkart. Analysts say e-commerce sales this season may\u00a0be a make-or-break for many\u00a0Indian online retail firms, especially Flipkart, which competes with US giant Amazon.In June, Amazon, Inc announced an additional investment of USD 3 billion into its Indian unit. This comes after it exhausted its investment of USD 2 billion announced in July 2014.This fresh infusion of funds comes at a time when homegrown e-commerce firms are struggling to raise money.So far, Flipkart seems to have trumped peers, at least when it comes to pricing strategy\u00a0for mobile phones.\u00a0According to a report by Bangalore-based research firm RedSeer, Flipkart reported lowest median prices across popular non-exclusive mobile stock keeping units listed on its platform compared to Amazon and Snapdeal on Monday.\u00a0The median price for non-exclusive mobile phone stood at Rs 7,500 on Flipkart compared to Rs 7,900 and Rs 7,800 on Amazon and Snapdeal, respectively.\u00a0Amazon, however, led the race when it came to consumer, electronics and large appliances segment. The same was reported to be Rs 4,050 for Amazon Rs 4,200 for Flipkart and Rs 4,300 for Snapdeal, RedSeer said.According to RedSeer, television continued to be the primary source that has created awareness about the festive sales to people. Nearly 68 percent of the total people surveyed said they were aware of the ongoing festive sales of at least one of the e-commerce firms. Of it, 64 percent said they got to know about the sales through television ads. Social media followed by making 49 percent people aware of the same, as per the RedSeer survey.

Invest Now Suresh SadagopanThere was one hilarious commercial some time back from an automobile company which played on the Indian psyche of putting overwhelming emphasis on the mileage over everything else. \u201cKitna\u00a0 deti\u00a0 hai?\u201d, was the question that the curious onlooker had asked of an incredulous protagonist \u2013 one was explaining about Rockets, another a luxury Yatch & yet another about a new generation battle tank! But, I was not surprised; for I face the same questions from those I deal with.Focus on the basics :\u00a0\u00a0 What are we trying to achieve in life? Are we trying to get maximum returns to the exclusion of everything else? If so, will it solve all the problems?Most people focus on returns and chase products that offer the best returns at any point. There is indeed an insistent belief that high returns are something that we need to constantly strive for, to get ahead in life.\u00a0 Hence, we tend to pick up the products which are \u201chot\u201d or trending, at any given point.\u00a0 The predominant majority get it wrong as they join the bandwagon pretty late \u2013 whether it is a stock market rally or a gold / real estate surge. In doing so, they typically tend to get in when the rally is well underway. In such a situation, they tend to purchase at inflated prices which will cap their upsides or worse still, set them up for potential downsides when the rally blows over.Let me take an example. Suppose, Ramesh has bought real estate in 2012 when the markets were doing reasonably well. However, the markets have turned turtle and are offering low to negative returns since.\u00a0 If Ramesh has bought property, just to ride the wave, a lot of things would have gone horribly wrong.Firstly, the objective of fantastic return has not been met. Secondly, Ramesh has taken some loans which he is servicing and paying a high interest for an asset, which is not appreciating.\u00a0\u00a0 He has not considered any other parameter while investing \u2013 like liquidity, concentration risk, risk inherent in this asset, tenure, returns etc. This has been a blind investment into what is essentially an illiquid product. Ramesh wants to sell & exit \u2013 but cannot, as there are no buyers! He is now badly stuck.\u00a0 Many would be able to identify with this.People get into such transactions based on early successes. They tend to feel invincible, if the first few transactions go well. Bets go up steadily with each transaction \u2013 which is where the problem is.\u00a0 Eventually when the cycle turns, they are left holding their lemons. A string of successes in the beginning is, however, a wrong teacher!People advertise their successes while quietly burying their failures in investment.\u00a0 When some talk passionately about their successes, there are many who get taken in \u2013 and the cycle of people trooping in to feed a frenzy,\u00a0 gets underway. \u00a0While moving from product to product chasing returns, we fail to consider important parameters which are equally important \u2013 like liquidity, risk-reward, suitability, tenure etc. Such dalliances hardly help in progressing towards smooth achievement of the goals.Focus on goals :\u00a0 What is important in life is to achieve the significant goals one may have.\u00a0 In fact, achieving our goals in the time frames that we want is what is of paramount importance. \u00a0The typical high priority goals are \u2013 retirement, children\u2019s education, acquiring a home etc.\u00a0 Each goal will have a certain time horizon. Investments will have to be done so that we may be able to meet the goals. Hence, the investment should be such that it is consistent with the need to achieve the goal. For instance, if Ramesh wants to plan for child\u2019s education, it might be a decade away. For this goal, his investments can be in comparatively aggressive assets like equities.\u00a0 In this case, near term liquidity is not a concern area, tenure of the investment can be long & regular income is not necessary. Once we decide on the instrument which has the potential for good returns, we can stay invested and not liquidate it to chase the next rainbow which appears on the horizon. Many of the assets have their cycles & those who stay invested for long, get to weather the cycles better; also, with longer tenure, the inherent risk reduces & the return potential improves. Market timing becomes less and less important, if the tenure is long.Strategic & Tactical asset allocation :\u00a0 Normally, client\u2019s assets are allocated based on their goals, how long the client has till retirement, their risk tolerance levels & other considerations like liquidity, risk-reward of the asset, requirement of regular returns & their frequency etc.Once the assets have been allocated as per such considerations, it should be allowed to work. For that, the assets should be allowed to remain invested for long to show desired results. That is the strategic asset allocation.Based on the movements in the markets & based on opportunistic considerations, one may want to bring in some new assets which are doing well then & make certain changes to the portfolio. But these changes should be such that they tinker around the edges & not change the core allocation. This is a tactical asset allocation to potentially take advantage of the unfolding opportunities.\u00a0 A change in the portfolio constitution of 10-15% can be fine when it comes to tactical allocation. If it goes beyond that, it will change the strategic asset allocation that has been suggested, which is not desirable.In summary :\u00a0 Goal achievement is what is really important.\u00a0 Hence, it is important to keep the focus on the life goals, more than what investment returns one gets at any point. One should invest in a disciplined manner following the strategic asset allocation suggestions, which is what ensures goal achievement. It is not necessary to get all excited about assets which are doing well at some intermediate point; it\u2019s more important to stay focused on the goal and stick to a plan than running like a hare in all directions. Reviews (of both the plan & the portfolio ) are to be done regularly, to make any changes in the allocations. High returns are wrongly seen as what helps one achieve goals. Also, it helps to understand that in a diversified portfolio, all components would not be doing well, always. But, a properly constructed portfolio would have various components and they need to be kept intact. Worrying about some component that is not performing is another common fallacy.\u00a0 What should be seen is whether the portfolio as such is performing well. Disciplined investments & sticking to the suggested allocation / portfolio is what actually helps achieve one\u2019s goals. \u00a0We need to wean ourselves away from our near obsession with returns \u2013 in our best interests.

Invest Now Shares of steel stocks rallied on government\u00a0 boosters as minimum import price (MIP) on 66 steel products is extended by another two months to protect the industry against cheap imports. The 66 products include semi-finished products of iron or non-alloyed steel, flat rolled products of different widths, bars and rods. Stocks like Hindustan Zinc, Hindalco, Jindal Steel, JSW Steel and Tata Steel gained over 1 percent from previous close.In August this year, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) had extended MIP on the same products of iron and steel till October 4. MIP had first come into place in February this year on 173 steel products in range of USD 341-752. India\u2019s steel industry has been suffering not only due to cheap imports from countries like China, Japan and Korea, but also due to the recent fall in steel prices globally. The top steel companies had reached out to the government early this year to impose MIP on imports to safeguard the domestic industry against imports.(With inputs from PTI)                         Discover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Invest Now People will be shopping for health online, requesting medicines from a wearable, which in turn, could be sending a BP alert. Doctors and patients would be communicating on the cloud, on the move, while medicine tests would be happening proactively, even as medicines, treatment as well as prognosis could be turning extremely personalized. Organs (transplants, etc., Trials) will be redone in. Trials will fathom elusive answers and medicines will know exactly what to cure and where. Wait, replace every \u2018would be,' \u2018will be,' \u2018can be\u2019 from there. It is all happening or imminent enough. The way we see doctors and hospitals is all set to undergo a massive change \u2013 all thanks to technology. The Future Beckons Dr. Rafael Grossmann is a name that made a lot of headlines. Not for the surgery but the how of it. Yes, he has already done it and has become the first surgeon to wear Google Glass during an operation. Wearable technology has moved beyond fitness trackers, and everyone from users to healthcare providers and a new realm of patients and practitioners are keenly applying it for better experience and administration of healthcare. In fact, by 2018, some two million employees will be required to wear health and fitness tracking devices as a condition of employment, as per a Gartner reckoning. Emergency responders, such as police officers, firefighters, and paramedics, would need them for tapping heart rates and respiration, and potentially their stress levels, which could be remotely monitored and help could be sent immediately if needed. Same goes for professional athletes, political leaders, airline pilots, industrial workers and remote field workers. Think of self-driving cars, drones, holographic computing, wearables inside our body and how these technologies, are going to be in everyday use by 2025. As a Gartner analyst translates the shift - The next ten years will put the last ten to shame, generating an order of magnitude more change than anything we've witnessed thus far. It is indeed hard to argue with - we\u2019ve entered a permanent state of hyper-adoption, characterized by the rapid, simultaneous uptake of new technologies at an unprecedented rate. As per an Accenture survey, 40% patients globally are willing to wear fitness tracking technology. At the same time, 73% executives find positive ROI from personalization technologies. Things are changing, for sure. The Market Incision USD 228.7 Billion! That\u2019s the size of the cut that technologies are making in the overall healthcare IT market as soon as 2020. This reflects a CAGR of 13.4% during the forecast period of 2015 to 2020. This would spur regulatory guidelines, government initiatives for eHealth, high return on investment (ROI), and rising needs to curtail escalating healthcare costs. For instance, clinical solutions segment is poised to grow at the highest CAGR of 19.8% thanks to the\u00a0need for improved patient safety and patient care, stringent regulations regarding healthcare provider solutions, and need for integrated health systems; as MarketsandMarkets has diagnosed recently. Think of India specifically and Gartner augurs that health care providers in India may be spending as much as $1.2 billion on IT products and services in 2016, an increase of 3.4% over 2015. This would entail health care providers (includes hospitals, as well as ambulatory service and physicians practices) on internal services, software, IT services, data center, devices and telecom services. Not Just Cosmetic Surgery Healthcare and technology are much entwined now. We are talking about artificial hearts, electronic aspirin, optogenetics, organ reconstruction, microchip modeling clinical trials, ultra-smart sensors inside the body and what not when we think of the new incarnation of healthcare. For instance, after 2011, digestible sensors have jumped the theory to the application page and are fast covering the road to equip healthcare professionals with more information about the human body or medicines interplay with each system of organs. Medical use of 3D printing is already happening. Stem cells, blood vessel or heart tissue, cartilage replacement, cancer treatment, will spread the impact of 3D printing everywhere soon. Wearables are now managing chronic conditions, helping patients to recover more quickly from injuries, tracking physical and environmental abnormalities and averting serious health issues or habits. The Indian Story What could be the implication in India? Could this revolution change the industry? Healthcare in India is at a crossroad. A growing section of the public is health conscious mainly due to the dissemination of information made available through television and the internet. Fitness wearables are the rage which shows a person\u2019s heart rate, mileage, calories consumed and sleep cycles. Most newspapers have a health section with people writing in questions; television has doctors providing insight into diseases and how to combat them, numerous blogs on how to eat healthily and stay fit. Medical costs are cheaper compared to other advanced nations. Yet, a vast section of the society is also quite traditional and clings on to age-old beliefs and practices. Keeping in mind the ever burgeoning population, health is a big challenge in India.\u00a0 Providing affordable and quality healthcare for every Indian, though etched in the Constitution remains a distant reality. Technology could thus play an important role to bridge this gap. For instance, telemedicine could be a great way to ensure affordable health care reaches the rural masses. Recently, the government set up facilities in remote locations, namely Community Health Centre, Pooh in District Kinnour of Himachal Pradesh; Pampa Hospital, Sabarimala in Kerala and Sheshnag base camp on the way to Amarnath Shrine. During the launch, the Union Minister for Health, JP Nadda, reiterated the resolve of the government to strengthen tertiary healthcare in all its premium institutions by deploying latest technology. Going by the awareness and the government\u2019s initiative on the digital front, it is a no-brainer that healthcare industry will be revolutionized in the days to come.\n                               Discover the latest Business News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Invest Now Chaitanya Gudipatymoneycontrol.com Late Tuesday, Google showcased how the combination of Pixel smartphones, Google Assistant and other accessories can make life simpler. The Internet giant is betting on people\u2019s hunger for technology with its artificial intelligence-powered Google Assistant. Unlike its predecessor Google Now which can set alarms, check your mails, help you with navigation and web searches, among many other things, Google Assistant is highly personal. The artificial intelligence-powered assistant combines machine learning and image recognition. Imagine this: You are chatting with a friend about a movie you both want to watch. Behind the scenes, Google Assistant is tabulating a vast number of metrics such your location, preferences, cineplexes you like and personal thoughts to throw up the best possible option. This tabulation requires the AI to learn about you (read collect and analyse data) as much as possible to give you an accurate results. Sure, it can make life simpler by suggesting you places to eat, tell you weather, or even crack a joke. But what is it asking in return for the highly-personalised service? Answer: Data access and personal information. The more you use it, the more it learns about your habits and preferences. The protocols pertaining to artificial intelligence, or the lack of it, make our data less secure and more vulnerable.Unencrypted messages are required for Google Assistant or any AI to function to the best of its capabilities. This unfettered access to data puts users at risk both to government surveillance and hackers. Not just that, Google has responsibilities towards its partners too and this can prompt the company to offered sponsored results by possibly creating a revenue stream. Social media sites Facebook and Twitter are already offering sponsored searches in users\u2019 feeds. Meanwhile, Google\u2019s chat app Allo has a very good encryption. Turning on encryption would mean that you won\u2019t be able to use Google Assistant, which defeats the purpose of artificial intelligence in the first place.

    "text": "The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) monetary policy announcement may indicate the central bank will water down its previous inflation-targeting framework, according to Nomura analysts. It set its medium-term inflation target at 4 percent, within a band of plus or minus 2 percent, but maintained the 5 percent target by March 2017. The target for the real neutral interest rate, or the rate at which the economy is growing at its trend rate with stable inflation, was also lowered to 1.25 percent on the back of lower global rates, from an earlier range of 1.5 to 2 percent.  \"We believe that there has been a dilution of the tenets of flexible inflation targeting framework under the new regime compared with the old regime,\" said Nomura analysts Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf in a Tuesday note.  They noted that under the old regime, led by former Governor Raghuram Rajan, the RBI was clear about lowering inflation to 4 percent by March 2018 and keeping it there. The new medium term target was \"too wide a range, without a specific time commitment to the midpoint.\"  Consumer price inflation in India eased to 5.05 percent on-year in August, compared with July's 6.07 percent, on the back of slower rises in food prices. Wholesale prices were up 3.74 percent on-year, a touch higher than July's reading of 3.55 percent, but below market expectations. Analysts, however, pointed out most of the growth drivers were consumption-oriented, which could put pressure on prices in the future.  For the real rate target, Varma and Saraf said they were not sure about the \"sanctity of the new number,\" and with global rates near zero, they expected it to be lowered further.  The makeup of the RBI's decision-making has also changed: This was the first meeting with a six-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which was led by new Governor Urjit Patel. The MPC effectively gives the government a voice in central bank decision-making through three appointed external members. Previously, the central bank governor alone made policy decisions. On Tuesday, all six members voted to lower the repo rate.  The RBI said it expected India's growth momentum to quicken, with a normal monsoon season expected to raise agricultural growth and rural demand, while plans to raise government employee salaries would provide stimulus to urban consumption spending. Strong improvements in farming practices were expected to improve the food inflation outlook, the central bank added. Earlier this year, the Indian government followed recommendations from the Seventh Pay Commission's recommendations and announced a 23.55 percent hike in salaries and pensions for nearly 10 million current and former government employees, reported Reuters. Radhika Rao, an economist at Singapore's DBS Bank, said the MPC would find it challenging to keep to their inflation target in fiscal 2017-18 and would need to work closely with the government to keep prices stable.  That's in part because the 4 percent inflation target implicitly held the RBI responsible for the direction of food prices, which is the largest component of the consumer price index (CPI) basket, according to Rao.  In order to bring down overall inflation, food prices needed to be under control. They were, however, dependent on things outside the RBI's influence: the weather, seasons and the infrastructure in place to ensure the delivery of agricultural produce from farms to the homes of consumers.  \"As we witnessed in the past three years, the RBI had little direct control over the price increases of cereal in fiscal 2011-12, vegetables in fiscal 2012-13 and pulses [legumes] last year,\" she said, adding this was where the RBI needed government support to keep food prices under control. The government had been working to keep inflation stable by removing diesel subsidies, modestly raising the prices at which it buys crops from farmers and implementing administrative measures to curb hoarding and other malpractices that intentionally keep food supply low, Rao said in a Tuesday note.  For example, in late 2015, local media reported nearly 75,000 tons of legumes were seized from hoarders in as many as 13 states.  She also pointed out several other obstacles to the RBI's medium-term inflation target: higher aggregate demand next year due to a normal monsoon, salary increases from the Seventh Pay Commission's recommendations and steady-to-higher food prices from structural inadequacies caused by uneven rainfall throughout the country during the monsoon season. Depending on how much rain a particular region receives, different crops would be affected. Rao explained the current infrastructure was not up to par to tackle a supply shortage in any particular crop, which tends to drive food prices higher. The implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) was also expected to temporarily boost price pressures. \"We expect the GST implementation to result in a 20 to 70 basis-point increase in headline inflation as we expect asymmetric pricing behavior by firms,\" added Nomura's Varma and Saraf. That meant firms were expected to pass on the service tax increase to consumers, but would absorb lower manufacturing taxes in their margins.  But while these inflation pressures may make hitting the longer-term inflation target difficult, in the shorter term, there were signs that inflation could ease.  Most analysts now expected the RBI to lower rates by another 25 basis points by March 2017, but some said it might make more sense to cut rates at its next meeting in December as near-term inflation was likely to have moderated further in September.

    "summary": "Indian indices extended gains on Thursday, led by IT and pharma stocks, with Nifty supported by dovish Fed cues. Analysts recommend buy-on-dips with stock picks including KFin Technologies, Ashok Leyland, Axis Bank, and Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories.",
    "text": "Indian benchmark indices continued their winning streak on Thursday led by gains in IT and pharma stocks. Nifty remained volatile after a gap-up start, driven by a dovish Fed announcement. Commenting on the day\u2019s action, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities said that The short-term trend is likely to stay positive as the index is comfortably trading above its critical moving average. \"The daily RSI is in a bullish crossover and rising above the previous swing high, indicating strengthening momentum. In the near term, support is placed at 25,300 and 25,150. On the other hand, crucial resistance is seen at 25,500. A decisive move above this level could trigger a rally towards 26,000. Overall, a buy-on-dips strategy remains favorable in the current market scenario,\" De said.Here are 4 stock recommendations for Friday: Stop Loss: Rs 132 Target: Rs 148Ashok Leyland is displaying a strong bullish structure with a clear pattern of Higher Highs and Higher Lows on the daily chart, signaling sustained uptrend momentum. Price is trading comfortably above all major EMAs (20/50/100/200), reflecting solid underlying strength, while the RSI at 67 suggests healthy momentum without being overextended. The recent breakout above the 7136-137 zone confirms fresh buying interest, supported by rising volumes. Immediate support is seen around 8132, while the next potential upside targets lie in the R144-148 zone, making the risk-reward favorable for positional traders. Buy in range 136-138, stop loss at 132, target 148.(Drumil Vithlani, Technical Analyst, Bonanza Portfolio) Target: Rs 1,200Stop Loss: Rs 1,100 Axis Bank is showing signs of a strong bullish reversal as the stock has recently broken out above its 200-day EMA, signaling a reversal from a crucial support zone and strengthening the case for continued upside. On the daily timeframe, the formation of three consecutive bullish candles reinforces positive sentiment, suggesting sustained buying interest. If the stock manages to break above Rs 1,138, it could trigger a move to fill the recent gap near Rs 1,154, with the potential to extend further toward Rs 1,200 in the near term. Place stop loss at Rs 1,100.(Amruta Shinde, Research Analyst, Choice Broking) Target: Rs 1,400Stop Loss: 1,300Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories is forming a rounding bottom pattern on the daily timeframe, which indicates the potential for a sustained bullish reversal. The stock has also moved out of a short consolidation phase with the formation of a strong bullish candle, creating a confluence of positive signals that reinforce the technical setup. A decisive move above Rs 1,340, backed by strong volumes, would further validate the breakout and open the way toward Rs 1,400 in the near term. Immediate support is placed at Rs 1,300, with a protective stop-loss at Rs 1,290.(Amruta Shinde, Research Analyst, Choice Broking) Target: Rs 154Stop Loss: Rs 132Ashok Leyland has recently broken out of a rounding bottom formation, consistently making higher highs and higher lows on the daily chart. This breakout was followed by a successful retest, and the stock is now showing renewed upward momentum. The move past its recent swing high, along with the formation of a bullish candle marking a fresh all-time high, adds to the confluence of bullish signals that strengthen the overall setup. A decisive close above Rs 140, supported by strong volumes, would further confirm the breakout and open the path toward Rs 154 in the near term. From a trading perspective, a buy-on-dips strategy near the current level looks attractive, with immediate support at Rs 134 and a stop-loss at Rs 132 to manage risk.(Amruta Shinde, Research Analyst, Choice Broking)(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The Nifty ended at 25,423.60, up 93.35 points or 0.37%, while the BSE Sensex closed at 83,013.96, rising 320.25 points or 0.39%. Here are seven stocks that were in focus today Shares surged over 12% to end at Rs 502.30 on the NSE, after hitting a 52-week high of Rs 513.35. The rally came after the company completed a preferential share allotment worth nearly Rs 1,500 crore to promoter entity Rising Sun Holdings Private Limited. Shares jumped 4.3% to Rs 369.40 on the NSE after subsidiary Biocon Biologics secured U.S. FDA approval for two denosumab biosimilars, along with a provisional interchangeability designation to drive broader adoption. Shares extended gains on the second day of listing, closing at Rs 169.95, up 1.87% from Wednesday. The stock has now surged 65% over its issue price of Rs 103. Shares rose 11% to close at Rs 137.35 on the BSE after reports said India\u2019s first large private gold mine in Andhra Pradesh is likely to begin full-scale production sooner than expected. Shares fell for the third straight day, ending at Rs 568.30, down 5.65%. The stock has lost 11% over the last three sessions. Shares were locked in a 5% lower circuit at Rs 60.84 on the NSE, a day after debuting on the bourses. The stock has slipped back to its IPO price of Rs 61 per share. Shares hit the 5% lower circuit for the second consecutive session, plunging to Rs 124.51 on the NSE. The fall followed the company\u2019s announcement of an immediate exit from the domestic airport lounges business.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

    "text": "China\u2019s central bank has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, even after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut rates. Authorities appear in no rush to ease monetary policy, focusing instead on managing growth while avoiding overheating in markets. (Source: Reuters) The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) left the seven-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 1.40%. On Thursday, it injected 487 billion yuan ($68.56 billion) through open market operations. This rate remains the main policy tool guiding China\u2019s monetary strategy. China\u2019s economy is slowing, but the deceleration is not as severe as expected, according to Hui Shan, chief China economist at Goldman Sachs. Strong exports and a sharp stock market rally have reduced the urgency for new stimulus, with some planned policy support potentially postponed to next year. Ting Lu of Nomura cautioned that major stimulus could inflate stock bubbles, though the central bank might deliver a modest 10-basis-point cut if markets correct. Xing Zhaopeng of ANZ said easing measures could come in the fourth quarter to help China meet its growth target of around 5%. China\u2019s stock market continues to perform strongly, with the Shanghai Composite Index hovering near 10-year highs. Analysts are closely watching export data, stock trends, and economic growth to gauge the need for potential policy support. Long-term structural reforms remain a priority alongside short-term growth management. The fourth plenum, scheduled for October, is expected to shape policy focus. While the annual growth target remains around 5%, the central bank may consider easing measures later this year to keep the economy on track.
